for further exploration and development
of Reserve #1 and exploration of Reserve
#4 (Alaska).
-The Mined Area Protection Act, es-
tablishing standards that would permit
mining of coal to go forward while mini-
mizing environmental impact.
-The Deepwater Port Facilities Act,
authorizing the Secretary of the Interior
to grant permits for the construction and
operation of ports beyond the three-mile
limit.
-The Minerals Leasing Act, placing
all mineral exploration and mining activ-
ities on Federal lands under a modernized
leasing system.
-A drilling investment tax credit to
provide an incentive for exploratory drill-
ing for new oil and gas fields.
-Creation of a Federal Energy Ad-
ministration to deal with the current
energy problem and to carry out major
new activities in energy resource develop-
ment, energy information and energy
conservation.
-Creation of an Energy Research and
Development Administration to provide
a central agency for Federal energy re-
search and development programs.
-Creation of a Department of Energy
and Natural Resources to provide a new
70
Cabinet department for the comprehen-
sive management of energy and natural
resource programs.
Further key measures will be proposed
to the Congress in the very near future,
including a set of amendments to our en-
vironmental legislation that would pro-
vide the flexibility necessary to acquire
and use our fuel resources most efficiently
in times of shortage. I will continue to
propose legislative initiatives in order to
respond to the changing needs and priori-
ties generated by the energy problem.
In enacting this Energy Emergency Act
after long months of waiting by the Ameri-
can people, the Congress has sadly failed
in its responsibility. I believe the Nation
expects better. It deserves better.
In returning this bill, I pledge once
again the full cooperation of my Admin-
istration in the effort to provide energy
legislation which is responsive to the prob-
lems we face and responsible in its impact
on the economy and on the American
people.
