Informal Remarks on Departure From Paris.
April 7, 1974
Au revoir. I will come again.
A very warm goodby and a beautiful
day, but we had a very good visit with
our friends from France. Of course, we
couldn't go into many matters because
of the occasion, but also, it was an oppor-
tunity to see many other people from
around the world. But we always like to

Labor Standards Amendments of 1974.

about portions of this legislation, its basic
purpose to increase the minimum wage
for working men and women of this coun-

cans.
The federally legislated minimum wage
for most American workers has remained
static for 6 years despite a number of in-
creases in the cost of living. Raising the
minimum wage is now a matter of justice
that can no longer be fairly delayed.
This bill would raise the minimum
wage for most workers from $1.60 to $2.00
