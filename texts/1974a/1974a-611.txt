that joint efforts by the USA and USSR
in such fields of cooperation as medi-
cal science and public health, protection
and improvement of man's environment,
science and technology, exploration of
outer space and the world ocean, peace-
ful uses of atomic energy, agriculture and
transportation create conditions for an
accelerated solution of some urgent and
complicated problems facing mankind.
Such cooperation makes a substantial
contribution to the development of the
structure of American-Soviet relations,
giving it a more concrete positive content.
Both Sides will strive to broaden and
deepen their cooperation in science and

be established a Joint US-USSR Com-
mittee on Cooperation in Housing and
Other Construction which will determine
specific working programs.
For the purpose of enhancing the safety
of their peoples living in earthquake-prone
