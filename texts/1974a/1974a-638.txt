Public Papers of the Presidents
cated to, both from the standpoint of the
great NATO alliance but also from the
standpoint of two nations involved.
And so, I hope that this announcement,
which will be made in Washington within
the next few minutes, is one that will be
followed by the action that we all desire,
a cease-fire, and then the process of de-
veloping again a friendly relation between
two nations who are our allies and our
friends and, of course, are essential to the
whole great NATO alliance which is the
cornerstone of America's foreign policy
and the free world's foreign policy in all
of Western Europe.
Now, so much for the serious things
that we talked about. There were many
other things as well, but since we are off
on this track for a moment, just let me say
that as I look back over the 52 years that
Roy has referred to—and as a matter of
fact, he really counts those days; I hadn't
realized that it is just 22 years, but you
see, he keeps the budget and he knows all
about that sort of thing-but I realize as
we look at America's role in this poten-
tially explosive struggle between Turkey
and Greece, the role that we are playing
and will continue to play, that looking
back over the past 52 years that all of
us, as Americans, regardless of our parti-
san affiliation, can be proud of the role
America, our country, has played in mak-
ing this world a safer and better place for
all people on it, not just for ourselves.
I don't refer just to the event that
means the most to most Americans, be-
cause it our friends and our families and
so forth, I mean the ending of the war in
Vietnam, the fact that our young people
are not being drafted, these are things
that we all understand. But difficult, long,
arduous as that terrible struggle was, we
have to realize that other developments
have occurred over the past 5½ years
that will have far more lasting and far
greater effect in terms of building a peace-
ful world than simply ending that war on
the kind of a just and honorable basis that
was essential if we were able to continue
to play the role of world leader.
I refer, for example, to events that
didn't seem possible 5½ years ago: the
new relationship with those who rule over
one-fourth of all the people of the world,
the People's Republic of China; the new
relationship with the Soviet Union in
which we now have had three summit
meetings a fourth one to be scheduled
next year-and in which-while we still
recognize that with the Soviet Union, as
with the People's Republic of China, we
have great philosophical differences, dif-
ferences that are not going to be changed
by any kind of agreement that we may en-
ter into that nevertheless we have been
able to develop and are developing means
whereby peoples with different govern-
ments, different systems of government,
different principles, different ideals, can
settle those differences peacefully and can
work together rather than against each
other to build a more peaceful world.
I could refer also to more recent events.
Many of you followed the trip to the Mid-
dle East. And I think most Americans
perhaps were rather surprised to see the
great outpouring of real friendship for the
United States of America that was appar-
ent every place that we went, not just
with Egypt-Cairo and Alexandria—
where in the space of 2 days, there were
perhaps 6 to 6½ million people by most
estimates out, but in all the other capitals
that we visited, Saudi Arabia, Syria-
Damascus, the oldest inhabited city in the
602
