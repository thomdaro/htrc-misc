144 Armed Forces Day Message.
May 18, 1974
ON THIS Armed Forces Day over 2 mil-
lion American servicemen and women
stand ready, as always, to defend our
freedom. This day provides an occasion
for Americans everywhere to pay tribute
to them.
As we begin what promises to be an era
of reduced world tensions, we must not
forget the contribution which our soldiers,
sailors, airmen, marines and coast guards-
men make to the strength and security of
the free world. We must never lose sight
of the fact that our continued military
strength is the cornerstone of future
peace.
Once again, as in the days of George
Washington, our Armed Forces are being
manned by volunteers. In restoring that
honorable tradition we must demonstrate
our continuing support for the members
of our Armed Forces. The guardians of
America's liberties deserve the admira-
tion and respect of those they defend.
Armed Forces Day 1974 provides each
of us with a specific opportunity to ex-
press our appreciation to America's men
and women in uniform, and to their fami-
lies. In demonstrating our support for
them we can help ensure that our Armed
Forces of tomorrow will continue to be
composed of dedicated, professional, and
courageous young citizens-the finest our
society has to offer.
