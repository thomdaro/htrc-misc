Foreword
All the events of this year were played against the ever-darken-
ing background of Watergate. As these documents show, its pres-
ence grew as the year unfolded. Effective leadership is a prereq-
uisite for a great people and a great nation, and by August it was
clear that whatever its eventual outcome, a protracted trial of the
President in the Senate would deprive America of the leadership
it needed. It was also clear that my own political base in Congress
had become too weak to accomplish the important things that
needed to be done in America and in the world during the remain-
ing two years of my Administration. Therefore, on August 9th, in
the second year of my second term, I resigned as President of the
United States.
In my first Inaugural Address, I described the goals that I
would set for my Presidency. Through courage and steadfastness,
I said, we could make possible a generation of peace for men and
women all around the world. Through determination and dedica-
tion, I said, we could effect a new and meaningful rebirth of re-
sponsive and responsible government at every level in this country.
Although my Presidency ended before its full term, I believe
that the record of these years from 1969-1974 shows that these
great goals were not impossible dreams. During these years we
made real progress-sometimes slow but always sure-towards
achieving them.
Working together, I know, Americans can still make these goals
realities.
