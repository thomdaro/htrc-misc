FOREWORD
THIS IS THE last volume in the series of my Presidential Papers.
It covers eight months of a momentous and troubled year during
which we were able to make some significant progress towards
maintaining peace abroad, and towards building a new peacetime
prosperity at home.
During nineteen seventy-four, the problems of energy and the
economy were foremost among the Administration's domestic
policy concerns and plans. This was only America's second year
of peace after a decade of war and half a dozen years of a super-
heated wartime economy.
The effects of the oil embargo of 1973 were still being felt, and
we had to mobilize the American people behind the goal of energy
self-sufficiency. At the same time, we sought to ease the problem
by resolving the tensions and misunderstandings which strained
our relations with the oil-producing countries abroad.
During this year the few remaining economic controls which
had been imposed in 1971 were finally removed.
Our continuing concern about the quality of peacetime life in
America can be seen in the State of the Union Message to Con-
gress and in legislative proposals for a national health insurance
plan, for veterans' benefits, for the Legacy of Parks program, for
mass transportation, manpower training, campaign reform, and
for quality education, which were made during the year.
Because of a resolute and even-handed diplomacy we were able
to play a central role in easing the heated Arab-Israeli conflict.
The documents from the midsummer trip to Egypt, Saudi Arabia,
Syria, Jordan, and Israel, represent a significant first step in
improving decades of strained U.S.-Arab relations. The second
Soviet Summit, at the end of June, also moved us closer to sub-
stantial agreement on the whole range of issues concerning our two
nations.
