Public Papers of the Presidents
ing them. The budget that I propose for
fiscal year 1975 meets these standards. It
places special emphasis on:
-the proper fiscal balance to keep the
economy on the track to sustained
high employment and more stable
prices;
-a strong defense force in support of
our efforts to build an enduring struc-
ture of peace in the world;
-a comprehensive energy program to
deal with current shortages and to
reestablish our ability to be self-suffi-
cient in energy;
-the New Federalism philosophy of
strengthening the role of State and
local governments, and of the indi-
vidual citizen;
-basic reforms of major domestic pro-
grams; and
-efficient management of the Federal
Government in the years ahead,
through a more intensive focus on
the tangible results that programs
achieve.
In the face of economic uncertainty,
my budget recommendations provide for
a fiscal policy that would support high
employment while restraining inflation. It
would maintain the flexibility to take fur-
ther action, if needed, to offset the effects
of energy shortages. My budget recom-
mendations hold the rise of Federal spend-
ing to the minimum increases necessary.
The budget recommends total outlays
of $304.4 billion in 1975, $29.8 billion
more than in 1974, and anticipates re-
ceipts of $295 billion, a $25 billion in-
crease over 1974. About 90% of the
increase in outlays between 1974 and
1975 represents mandatory spending in-
creases that are unavoidable under
current law.
Under conditions of full employmentâ€”
conventionally defined as a 4% unem-
ployment rate-Federal receipts would be
substantially higher and outlays somewhat
lower than these figures. Thus, on a full
employment basis the budget shows a sur-
plus of $4 billion in 1974 increasing to $8
billion in 1975.
The budget proposes increases for de-
fense activities so that we can increase our
defense preparedness and preserve present
force levels in the face of rising costs.
These proposals reflect minimum prudent
levels of defense spending consistent with
maintaining adequate armed forces to
assure our national security.
The budget includes my program, Proj-
ect Independence, to reestablish our capa-
bility for self-sufficiency in energy. I plan
Federal funding of $10 billion for the
accelerated energy research and develop-
ment component of this program over the
next 5 years. Other measures already un-
derway or proposed will help reduce low-
priority energy use and minimize eco-
nomic dislocations due to shortages. Our
vigorous diplomatic efforts to restore an
acceptable pattern of world trade in petro-
leum will complement these measures.
