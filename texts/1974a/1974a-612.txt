ARTIFICIAL HEART RESEARCH
In the course of the implementation of
joint programs in the field of medical sci-
ence and public health, scientists and
specialists of both countries concluded
that there is a need to concentrate their
efforts on the solution of one of the most
important and humane problems of mod-
ern medical science, development of an
artificial heart. In view of the great
theoretical and technical complexity of
the work involved, the two Sides con-
cluded a special agreement on the sub-
ject. The US-USSR Joint Committee for
Health Cooperation will assume respon-
sibility for this project.
ects following the US-USSR space flight
now scheduled for July 1975.
TRANSPORT OF THE FUTURE
Aware of the importance of developing
advanced modes of transportation, both
Sides agreed that high-speed ground sys-
tems of the future, including a magneti-
cally levitated train, which can provide
economical, efficient, and reliable forms
of transportation, would be a desirable
and innovative area for joint activity. A
working group to develop a joint research
cooperation program in this area under
the 1973 Agreement on Cooperation in
the Field of Transportation will be estab-
lished at the Fall meeting of the Joint
US-USSR Transportation Committee.
COOPERATION IN SPACE
The two Sides expressed their satisfac-
tion with the successful preparations for
the first joint manned flight of the Ameri-
can and Soviet spacecraft, Apollo and
Soyuz, which is scheduled for 1975 and
envisages their docking and mutual visits
of the astronauts in each other's space-
craft. In accordance with existing agree-
ments fruitful cooperation is being carried
out in a number of other fields related to
the exploration of outer space.
Attaching great importance to further
American-Soviet cooperation in the ex-
ploration and use of outer space for peace-
ful purposes, including the development
of safety systems for manned flights in
space, and considering the desirability of
consolidating experience in this field, the
two Sides agreed to continue to explore
possibilities for further joint space proj-
ENVIRONMENTAL PROTECTION
Desiring to expand cooperation in the
field of environmental protection, which
is being successfully carried out under the
US-USSR Agreement signed on May 23,
1972, and to contribute to the implemen-
tation of the "Man and the Biosphere"
international program conducted on the
initiative of the United Nations Educa-
tional, Scientific and Cultural Organiza-
tion (UNESCO), both Sides agreed to
designate in the territories of their respec-
tive countries certain natural areas as
biosphere reserves for protecting valuable
plant and animal genetic strains and eco-
systems, and for conducting scientific re-
search needed for more effective actions
concerned with global environmental
protection. Appropriate work for the im-
plementation of this undertaking will be
conducted in conformity with the goals of
the UNESCO program and under the
