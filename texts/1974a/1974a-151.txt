energy shortage. Along these lines, the
Congress should enact the proposals I
made last year to improve our regular un-
employment insurance system by estab-
lishing higher minimum benefit standards
and extending coverage to farm workers.
Under conditions of full employment
the budget outlays I propose would be less
than the receipts from present and pro-
posed taxes by about $4 billion in 1974
and $8 billion in 1975. A 4% rate of un-
employment is used as a measure of full
employment in calculating these sur-
pluses. These surpluses, following a small
full-employment deficit in 1973, and ris-
ing somewhat from 1974 to 1975, are con-
sistent with our objective of moderate
restraint.
In large part, the estimated increase in
the full-employment surplus is the result
of the high inflation rate experienced in
calendar year 1973 and expected to con-
tinue for the first half of 1974. In the
short run, inflation increases receipts more
than it increases outlays. Thus, it increases
for a time the surplus that would be
achieved at high employment. This means
that the budget has the effect of restrain-
ing inflation. The rising full-employment
surpluses estimated here are largely the
product of an inflation that is proceeding
too rapidly. To use the size of these sur-
pluses as an invitation or an excuse for
more spending would only make the infla-
tion rate worse.
A 4% unemployment rate is used in
calculating full-employment receipts and
outlays as a conventional standard which
approximately removes the effects on the
budget estimates of year-to-year changes
in the level of economic activity. To serve
this purpose the unemployment rate used
for the calculations must be reasonably
stable from year to year. However, this
does not mean that the feasible and proper
target for unemployment is always repre-
sented by the same figure. In fact, as a re-
sult of changes in the composition of the
labor force, a 4% overall unemployment
rate today would mean much tighter con-
ditions in labor markets than would have
been true ten or twenty years ago.
The estimates of receipts in this budget
include the windfall profits tax on oil
producers which I have proposed. This
tax would recapture the excess profits
that these producers would otherwise real-
ize due to rising oil prices.
I continue to urge action on the tax
reform and simplification proposals that
were discussed with Congress last year.
These proposals would not appreciably
