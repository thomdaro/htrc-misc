Public Papers of the Presidents
Arabia and Foreign Minister Ismail Fahmy of
Egypt responded to the President's remarks as
follows:
MINISTER OF STATE AL-SAQQAF
My friend, thank you very much.
I think you see me now for the third time.
You might notice that I am better relaxed.
The reason is that I have had a very good and
constructive discussion with the President and
with the Secretary.
I think Mr. President summarized every-
thing, and I don't need to add anything, except
that we feel hopeful that something will hap-
pen and soon, for the benefit of the United
States, of the Middle East, for the world as a
whole.
Thank you.
FOREIGN MINISTER FAHMY
We had, as the President has just said, an
extended discussion, and very constructive, and
we are very pleased-after conveying to the
President the decisions which were taken
unanimously by the four heads of government
in Algeria-we are very pleased, as you have
heard the President, that the United States
will continue to work for a permanent and just
peace in the Middle East, for the benefit of
the countries of this area. And we welcome his
approval of dispatching the Secretary of State
to the area again to start contacts with the
Syrians and the Israelis to start working on a
disengagement on that front as the United
States actively participated before, so far as the
Egyptian front, and there was a successful
result from the U.S. efforts in that regard.
Thank you.
53 Message to the Congress Transmitting Reports on the
Military Incentive Awards Program. February 20, 1974
To the Congress of the United States:
In 1965, the Congress authorized par-
ticipation by military personnel in a pro-
gram of cash awards for suggestions,
inventions and scientific achievements.
Nearly 1.5 million suggestions have been
submitted since that time, and the pro-
gram has successfully motivated military
personnel to seek ways of reducing costs
and improving efficiency. Of those sugges-
tions submitted, 235,378 have been
adopted, resulting in tangible first-year
benefits in excess of $728 million.
During fiscal year 1973, 131,944 sugges-
tions were submitted and 20,854 were
adopted. The adopted suggestions repre-
sent tangible first-year benefits of $66,-
525,250.87, as well as many additional
benefits and improvements of an intan-
gible nature. Cash awards in fiscal year
1973 totalled $1,467,531.98, of which 82
percent went to enlisted men.
In accordance with the provisions of 10
U.S.C. 1124, I am forwarding reports of
the Secretary of Defense and the Secre-
tary of Transportation containing statisti-
cal information on this program and brief
descriptions of some of the more note-
worthy contributions made by military
personnel during fiscal year 1973.
The White House,
February 20, 1974.
RICHARD NIXON
NOTE: The 4-page report of the Secretary of
Defense and the 3-page report of the Secre-
tary of Transportation cover the period July 1,
1972-June 30, 1973.
