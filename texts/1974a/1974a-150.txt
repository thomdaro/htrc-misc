Nation's capacity for producing basic ma-
terials was used at a higher rate than in
any previous year since World War II.
New jobs were created for about 23/4 mil-
lion people. Unemployment fell from a
5.4% average rate in the second half of
calendar year 1972 to a 4.7% rate in the
second half of 1973. At the same time,
adverse weather and other conditions cut
into the world's food supplies, including
ours, while the policies of exporting coun-
tries cut supplies of oil and raised its price
sharply.
These developments created a severe
inflation during calendar year 1973, par-
ticularly in prices of food and energy. Our
budget policy has been a key element in
the effort to control that inflation. Strict
limitation of expenditures in 1973 applied
fiscal restraint to an economy that was
expanding at an unsustainable rate. The
budget totals recommended here con-
tinue a policy of fiscal responsibility as
part of a continuing anti-inflation
program.
There is now evidence that the econ-
omy is slowing down. In part this is due
to the energy shortage, which limits our
ability to produce some products and re-
duces demand for others. Our energy-use
policies are designed to minimize the ad-
verse impact of the energy shortage on the
economy, but some effect is inescapable.
Some slowdown in the growth of de-
mand is appropriate to help check infla-
tion. This is especially true in view of
supply limitations. But this slowdown
should not be permitted to go too far.
Therefore, I propose a budget which will
continue a posture of moderate restraint
rather than greatly intensifying that re-
straint. Also, my Administration is devel-
oping and will be prepared to use a range
of measures to support the economy if
that should be necessary-measures tai-
lored to the special conditions of the
