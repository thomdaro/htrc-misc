Public Papers of the Presidents
to the Congress my legislative requests in
energy before delivering my State of the
Union Address.
I first warned of approaching energy
shortages in a message to the Congress in
1971-the first energy message ever pre-
sented by an American President.¹ In
1973, an embargo was suddenly imposed
upon many of our foreign supplies of oil,
the crisis broke upon us, and the entire
country took the first steps toward coping
with the emergency. We have made solid
progress since then, but it is clear that our
efforts in 1973 were just the beginning.
As our first order of business in the new
year, therefore, let us resolve that 1974
shall be the year that we build a perma-
nent framework for overcoming the ener-
gy crisis.
In the initial portion of this message, I
want to report to the Congress on our
progress over the last three months. The
remainder of the message addresses the
legislative program on which I am urging
Congressional action in 1974:
-First, the proposals that I believe are
essential to meet the short-term emer-
gency, including:
.
A special energy act that would per-
mit restrictions on the private and
public consumption of energy and
would temporarily relax certain
Clean Air Act requirements for
power plants and automotive emis-
sions;
• A windfall profits tax that would pre-
vent private profiteering at the ex-
pense of public sacrifice;
Unemployment insurance to help
those who lose their jobs because of
the energy crisis;
¹ See 1971 volume, Item 195.
• And establishment of a Federal En-
ergy Administration.
-Second, the legislative proposals that
I have previously submitted in order to
meet our long-range goal of achieving
self-sufficiency in energy, including pro-
posals that would:
·
Allow market pricing of new natural
gas;
• Allow temporary oil production from
the Elk Hills Naval Petroleum Re-
serve in California;
• Permit surface mining of coal in a
manner that is environmentally safe;
• Permit the development of new deep-
water port facilities offshore;
• Amend the tax laws regarding drill-
ing investments;
• Modernize the laws regarding mineral
leasing on Federal lands;
• And reorganize the executive branch
so that it may deal more effectively
with energy and natural resource
problems.
-Third, proposals which are designed
to help us achieve self-sufficiency in en-
ergy and which I am submitting to the
Congress this year for the first time, in-
cluding proposals that would:
• Eliminate depletion allowances for
foreign oil and gas production;
• Accelerate the licensing and construc-
tion of nuclear facilities;
•
Require labeling of products for en-
ergy efficiency;
• And streamline the site selection
process for energy facilities.
In addition to these legislative propos-
als, the Administration is moving for-
ward this year with a series of executive
actions and studies relating to our long-
term energy needs. The latter are ad-
dressed in the last section of the message.
