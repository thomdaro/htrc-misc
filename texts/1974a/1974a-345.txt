which they, of course, want achieved. And
I would say that the prospects for the
cattlemen generally have to be good, be-
cause when we see the record production
or at least the record predictions of pro-
duction of feed grains, which will, of
course, become available in the summer
and in the fall and throughout the next
year, this can only mean that the cattle-
men and hog producers, other feeders and
so forth, are going to benefit from that in-
crease in production.
Another troublesome spot is one that
I have addressed on many occasions to au-
diences of this type and for many, many
years, going back perhaps over 27 years
of public life, and that is, there is still
too much of a spread between what the
farmer gets at the farm and what the con-
sumer pays at the market, supermarket,
grocery store, or what have you.
I do not say this in a sense of trying to
demagog about the retail trade people,
the supermarkets, et cetera, et cetera, but
I do say that at this particular time as we
look at beef prices, that spread is one
which most experts would agree is too
great, and it is one where I would hope
that those who are in the retail business,
those who are in the middle, will recognize
that they have a responsibility to reflect
the lower prices that the farmer is receiv-
ing in the prices that eventually the con-
sumer has to pay.
Turning now to what the prospects can
be for the future, I think there are several
factors that will be of interest to you. You
recall right after the oil embargo was
applied by the Arab countries, there was
a time, oh, running from November
through December, even into January,
when many economists predicted that
there was going to be a world recession and
that, because of the world recession, that
would inevitably have its effect on the
United States and that we would have
one as well.
Those predictions now appear to have
been premature. They not only appear to
have been premature, looking at the situa-
tion as we see it from now, I can, I think,
rather safely predict that the demand
for farm products, a demand which is
worldwide and which has been going up
because people are living a little better
all over the world, because the United
States is selling to more nationsâ€”the Peo-
ple's Republic of China, the Soviet Union,
others to whom we never sold before-
the world demand is going to increase.
And as that demand goes up, it means
that we can continue on our policy, which
is, I think, one that all farmers will sup-
port, and that is instead of having a
policy of scarcity and managing a scarcity,
we should have a policy of full produc-
tion and attempting to develop the mar-
kets abroad as well as at home so that
the farmer in the United States can pro-
duce to his maximum and know that
markets are going to be available for his
production.
A word about some of our policies that
may affect the welfare of farmers in the
future: First, with regard to trade gen-
erally, as I have pointed out recently in
meetings in Chicago and then again in
Houston, it is very important for us to
realize that in our relationships with our
friends and they are our friends, our
European friends and our friends in Asia,
like Japan, the great industrial coun-
tries we are having, as we have had in
the past and will have in the future, trade
negotiations, and I am insisting that our
trade negotiators see to it that American
