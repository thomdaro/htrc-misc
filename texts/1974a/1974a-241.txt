Richard Nixon, 1974
Feb. 25 [61]
Ash, and to our economic advisers that
we will be and should be prepared to deal
effectively with any areas of the country-
and there may be spot areas of hard-
ship-through the budget means, and we
have various contingency plans ready to
go.
We will not stand by and allow this
country-because of the energy crisis and
because of some of the problems we have
had on the inflation front-stand by and
allow a recession to occur. That is why I
have been so positive in saying that there
will be no recession.
I had better turn this way.
VETERANS BENEFITS
[12.] Q. Mr. President, sir, I want
to ask you something. I think you are
not-
THE PRESIDENT [to Sarah McClendon,
McClendon News Service]. You have the
loudest voice, you go right ahead.
Q. Good, thank you, sir. I don't think
you are fully informed about some of the
things that are happening in the Govern-
ment in a domestic way. I am sure it is
not your fault, but maybe the people that
you appointed to office aren't giving you
right information.
For example, I have just discovered
that the Veterans Administration has
absolutely no means of telling precisely
what is the national problem regarding
the payments of checks to boys going to
school under GI bill, and many a young
man in this country is being disillusioned
totally by his Government these days be-
cause of the hardships being put upon
him.
THE PRESIDENT. Well, this is a ques-
tion which you very properly bring to the
attention of the Nation. It is a question
that has already been brought to my at-
tention, I am sure, by a number of
people—
Q. But, sir, you had Mr.
THE PRESIDENT. and the ques-
tion—if I may give the answer now-is
very simply this. Mr. Don Johnson of the
Veterans Administration, as you know,
acted expeditiously when we had a case
in California. We have another one in
Illinois at the present time.
There are great numbers of veterans.
We have an adequate program to deal
with it, and I can assure you that when
any matter is brought to my attention or
to his, we will deal with it as quickly as
we can, because our Vietnam veterans and
all veterans deserve whatever the law pro-
vides for them, and I will see that they
get it.
Q. He is the very man I am talking
about who is not giving you the correct
information. He stood up here at the
White House the other day and gave us
false information. He has no real system
for getting at the statistics on this problem.
THE PRESIDENT. Well, if he isn't lis-
tening to this program, I will report to
him just what you said. [Laughter]
He may have heard even though
he wasn't listening to the program.
[Laughter]
REPUBLICAN CANDIDATES AND THE 1974
ELECTIONS
[13] Q. Mr. President, this is a
political question.
THE PRESIDENT. The others weren't
political? [Laughter]
Q. Jerry Ford's old House seat was won
by a Democrat who campaigned mainly
on the theme that you should be removed
or impeached or that you should resign.
