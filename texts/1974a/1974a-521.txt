Remarks on Arrival in Cairo, Egypt.
June 12, 1974
Mr. President, our very distinguished
guests, and ladies and gentlemen:
Mr. President, we have been greatly
touched by your generous remarks, and
we have also been enormously moved by
the reception we have received as we
passed through the streets of Cairo today.

And the United States welcomes the
opportunity to cooperate with you and
your government in your programs for
economic progress to which you are de-
voting and dedicating so much of your
very great energies today.
And also, as we saw those hundreds of
