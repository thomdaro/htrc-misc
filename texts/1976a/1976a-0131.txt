Address Before a Joint Session of the Congress Reporting
on the State of the Union. January 19, 1976
Mr. Speaker, Mr. Vice President, Members of the 94th Congress, and dis
tinguished guests:
As we begin our Bicentennial, America is still one of the youngest nations
in recorded history. Long before our forefathers came to these shores, men
and women had been struggling on this planet to forge a better life for them-

In man's long, upward march from savagery and slavery-throughout the

father and my mother. I know it will be better for my children because my
hands, my brains, my voice, and my vote can help make it happen.
It has happened here in America. It has happened to you and to me.
Government exists to create and preserve conditions in which people can
translate their ideas into practical reality. In the best of times, much is lost

have had the best of intentions.
But in the recent past, we sometimes forgot the sound principles that guided
us through most of our history. We wanted to accomplish great things and
