Gerald R. Ford, 1976
grams. I don't see any reason whatsoever for the Vice President to seek this
office. He has indicated that he is very happy being Vice President, supporting
my programs, and he has been very supportive of me personally.
Q. If you were to lose three or four primaries, do you think that situation
would continue to obtain?
THE PRESIDENT. I intend to be at the convention in Kansas City in August
and I expect to win there.
Q. Did you read his speech today-
THE PRESIDENT. I have read it and I talked to him personally.
Q. Did you regard that as a supportive opinion?
THE PRESIDENT. I think so, yes. In fact, he told me it was. And I saw him at
about 3:30 before I took the plane here.
Very nice to see you all.
REPORTER. Thank you.
NOTE: The exchange began at 5:10 p.m. at Dillant Hopkins Airport.

Remarks and a Question-and-Answer Session at a Public
Forum in Keene. February 19, 1976
Thank you very, very much, Jim, John Croteau, Reverend McCarty, Bob
Clark, Charlie Burns, the wonderful principal of this fine school, ladies and
gentlemen:
Gee, it's really great to be back in New Hampshire and particularly in
Keene, and I thank you all very, very much. Let me assure you that New Hamp-
shire is vitally important, and you can put us on the road to victory next
Tuesday.
Actually, the purpose of my visit can be summed up in just a very, very
few words. I believe very strongly in a strong and prosperous American auto-
mobile industry, but I am here to say that this year there is absolutely no reason
to trade in your Ford on a new model. Some of those new models might be
mighty expensive.
ADMINISTRATION GOALS
Actually, I am looking forward to your questions, but first let me make
just a very few brief remarks.
