Remarks at a Briefing for Representatives of Military
Organizations on Defense and Foreign

Secretary Clements, General Brown, General Scowcroft, members of the
Joint Chiefs of Staff, distinguished guests:

We have worked to achieve an unprecedented increase in United States
foreign trade, which has ensured hundreds of thousands of American jobs. The
United States has used its unique position, its position of confidence on both
