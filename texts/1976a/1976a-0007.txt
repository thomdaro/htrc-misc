FOREWORD
IN LIGHT of certain developments in November, one may justifiably wonder
why I consider 1976 among the most memorable and rewarding years of
my life.
Yet, taking a more detached view than the duties and decisions of 28 years
in Washington ever permitted, I am firmly convinced that our national Bicen-
tennial will long endure as a landmark in the American adventure.
No American who witnessed, who felt and was caught up in that spon-
taneous outpouring of unashamed pride in our country, that jubilant reaffirma-
tion of faith in the future of freedom, can ever forget our 200th birthday. Each
of us will remember that we had a part in the rebirth of confidence and com-
munity among all our citizens.
The spirit of 1976, soaring far above the customary celebrations of fun and
fireworks, stirred to life powerful and invigorating instincts deep in America's
soul. Independence, equality, self-discipline and mutual respect-these facets
of our national character not only survived two centuries of severe testing but
spread and were strengthened from sea to shining sea.
As a people, we learned that despite all difficulties, the world still looks with
envy and hope to the United States and its durable principles and ideals. And
we rededicated ourselves to them.
These pages record the official words and acts of the Presidency in the 200th
year of our independence, a year of peace at home and abroad, a year of eco-
nomic recovery and receding inflation, a year that closed with an orderly
transition of political responsibility befitting a mature and secure Republic.
It was, for me, a year in which I was immeasurably honored and rewarded by
the privilege of serving a great and good people.
The American adventure is a continuing process. It is my prayer that 1976
will be remembered not as the end of our first two centuries of national inde-
pendence, but as the beginning of a new era of independence for every
individual American.
