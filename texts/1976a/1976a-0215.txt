Statement on the Supreme Court Decision Concerning the
Federal Election Campaign Act Amendments of
1974. January 30, 1976
TODAY'S decision by the Supreme Court calls for quick action by political
leaders of this country, as well as by candidates for high office, to ensure that our
elections remain free from the undue influence of excessive spending.
As President, I will ask leaders of Congress to meet with me to discuss the
need for legislation to reconstitute the Commission or to assure by other mecha-
nisms enforcement of the Federal Election Act as modified by the Supreme
Court's decision.
I have asked the Attorney General to review the opinion and to advise me on
what steps, if any, should be taken to ensure that our elections remain free
from any abuses.
As a candidate for the Presidency, I am calling on others who seek this
office to join with me in adhering to the spending limit that had been estab-
lished under the 1974 law.
I am directing the President Ford Committee to limit its expenditures to that
level.

Veto of a Milk Price Support Bill. January 30, 1976
To the Senate of the United States:
I am withholding my approval from S.J. Res. 121, which would increase the
Federal support price for milk and require mandatory quarterly adjustments,
for the following reasons:
1. It would saddle taxpayers with additional spending at a time when we are
trying to cut the cost of government and curb inflation.
2. It would stimulate excessive production of milk, discourage consumption,
force the Federal government to increase purchases of dairy products
under the milk support program and build up huge and costly surpluses.
3. It would result in unnecessarily high consumer prices.
Under this bill, government outlays would be increased by $530 million,
including $180 million during the 1976-77 marketing year and $350 million
