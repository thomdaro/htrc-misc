But then we have an obligation also in certain fields, research and develop-
ment, to spend money today so that we can have exotic fuels to solve our energy
problem, make America energy independent, solar energy.
Just in passing, I increased the funding for research and development in solar

proud to be Americans.
Thank you very, very much.
NOTE: The President spoke at 1:17 p.m. at Rundlett Junior High School.

will make a decision on the basis of policies, the policies that I have imple-
mented, the policies that have proven successful as far our economy is con-
cerned, turning it around, starting it up on an upswing. I don't think they will
