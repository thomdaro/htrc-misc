Message to the Senate Transmitting the International
Coffee Agreement, 1976. April 5, 1976
To the Senate of the United States:
I am transmitting herewith, for the advice and consent of the Senate to ratifi-
cation, the International Coffee Agreement, 1976. In doing so, I am the fourth
President since 1962 to seek favorable Senate consideration of an International
Coffee Agreement. The 1976 Agreement is similar to those of 1962 and 1968,
but it contains a number of innovative features which represent a considerable
improvement for consumers. I strongly urge that the Senate give advice and
consent to ratification of this Agreement, thus agreeing that the spirit of coopera-
tion, which has characterized the international coffee community these part 14
years, should be continued and strengthened.
Negotiation of the 1976 Agreement began in January of 1975 and continued
throughout the year. On October 28, 1975, the Senate unanimously approved
the Protocol for the Continuation in Force of the International Coffee Agree-
ment of 1968, as Extended, which allowed the continued existence of the Inter-
