Letter to the Speaker of the House and the President of the
Senate Recommending Extension of the Federal Energy
Administration. February 16, 1976
THE FEDERAL Energy Administration Act of 1974, section 15(a), required
that I submit to the Congress six months before the expiration of this Act
my recommendations for the future of the Federal Energy Administration.
In view of my recent signing of the Energy Policy and Conservation Act
of 1975, I have determined that the management of energy policies and programs
can best be served by the extension of the Federal Energy Administration until
September 30, 1979â€”thirty-nine months beyond its current termination date
of June 30, 1976. This will allow an orderly phasing out of price and allocation
controls on domestic oil production over a period of forty months and imple-
mentation of other programs called for in that Act.
I have directed Federal Energy Administrator Zarb to seek the authority
required to carry out this proposal.
Sincerely,
NOTE: This is the text of identical letters ad-
dressed to the Honorable Carl Albert, Speaker of
GERALD R. FORD
the House of Representatives, and the Honorable
Nelson A. Rockefeller, President of the Senate.

elections. If it becomes an empty shell, public confidence in our political process
will be further eroded and the door will be opened to abuses in the coming
elections.
We can and we must reconstitute the Commission in the next 2 weeks. I am
today submitting essential legislation to get that job done, and I urge the Con-
