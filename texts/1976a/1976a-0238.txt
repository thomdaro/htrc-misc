bureaucracy was expanded. Power was drained away from the towns, from
the cities, from the States to an increasingly centralized National Governmentâ€”
always bigger, always more powerful, though not always more efficient.
If this course is pursued, it will mean much less incentive to create capital
and jobs and much more inflation. Two hundred years ago, men of vision
understood that poverty is abolished by economic growth, not by economic
