Gerald R. Ford, 1976
for the time that you have allotted for the discus-
sion that we have had in the last 3 days about the
problems that we face in our region and in the effort
to move towards peace.
I am sure that the talks have helped and, I hope,
will advance the cause of peace. I think these kind of
relations that you offer to me on a personal basis
as well as in the relations between our two countries
will be an encouragement to the cause of peace in
the area. And I would like to thank you very, very
much for your personal interest, personal help in
doing so.
And, Mr. President, towards the end of my visit
in Washington, again, thank you very, very much.

Message on the Observance of the Chinese
New Year. January 30, 1976
MRS. FORD and I send our warmest New Year greetings to our fellow citizens
of Chinese ancestry. We hope that the good fortune symbolized by the Year of
the Dragon will be with you and your families and that it will also abound in
our national life as we celebrate the Bicentennial of our Independence.
We hope that your celebrations of this festive event will be happy and
memorable for each of you.

Message on the Observance of International Clergy
Week. January 30, 1976
IN 1943, four chaplains died heroically in a gesture of unselfish love for others.
In the disaster which befell the transport ship Dorchester, they gave up their
lives in order to save other fellow countrymen on board.
It is most appropriate that Civitan International has dedicated the week of
February 1-7, 1976, to commemorate the supreme sacrifice of these four chap-
lains and in this way to honor clergymen everywhere. I am sure that the mem-
bers of Civitan are joined by all Americans at this time in expressing appreciation
to those who continue to work humbly and to serve both God and man.
