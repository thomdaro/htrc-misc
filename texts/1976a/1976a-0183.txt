join me sometime.

Hampshire?

Remarks Upon Signing the Economic Report for
1976. January 26, 1976
Good morning.
Before signing the Economic Report of the President, let me thank the mem-
bers of the Council of Economic Advisers, the Chairman Alan Greenspan, and
Paul MacAvoy, and Burton Malkiel.
Any document of this size and of this importance was not put together just by
the three members of the Council. It is the result of the effort and the talent, the
ability of the whole staff that work under the Chairman and the two members
of the Council.
There is one person that I have learned who has a lot to do with some 30
of these reports by various Presidents. Frances James ¹ has been with the Council
from its inception in 1946. She is concluding―I am not saying she is leaving—
but concluding 42 years of very outstanding service in the Federal Government
and has had a very significant impact in the preparation of 30 of these reports
by the President. And I congratulate her as well as the total staff.
As we move into 1976, I think we have to take a look back at 1975. It was a
very tough year, and a great many Americans have deep concerns even today
about unemployment as well as inflation. However, the progress that we have
made in the latter months of 1975 should give us strong hope and expectations
that 1976 will be a far better year.
