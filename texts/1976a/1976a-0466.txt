Remarks Upon Signing a Proclamation Concerning
Japanese-American Internment During World War II.
February 19, 1976
FEBRUARY 19 is the anniversary of a very, very sad day in American history.
It was on that date in 1942 that Executive Order 9066 was issued resulting in
the uprooting of many, many loyal Americans. Over 100,000 persons of Japanese
ancestry were removed from their homes, detained in special camps, and even-
tually relocated.
We now know what we should have known then-not only was that evacua-
tion wrong but Japanese-Americans were and are loyal Americans. On the
battlefield and at home the names of Japanese-Americans have been and con-
tinue to be written in America's history for the sacrifices and the contributions
they have made to the well-being and to the security of this, our common
Nation.
Executive Order 9066 ceased to be effective at the end of World War II. Be-
cause there was no formal statement of its termination, there remains some
concern among Japanese-Americans that there yet may be some life in that
obsolete document. The proclamation [4417] that I am signing here today
should remove all doubt on that matter.
I call upon the American people to affirm with me the unhyphenated Ameri-
can promise that we have learned from the tragedy of that long ago experience—
forever to treasure liberty and justice for each individual American and resolve
that this kind of error shall never be made again.
NOTE: The President spoke at 11:54 a.m. at a ceremony in the Cabinet Room at the White House.
