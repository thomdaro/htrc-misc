Gerald R. Ford, 1976
Federal taxpayer subsidies for the meals of children from families able to feed
themselves extends that Federal responsibility beyond the appropriate point.
In addition, under existing law, the 15 programs enacted into detailed legisla-
tion with the same objective-feeding needy and non-needy childrenâ€”have
resulted in a patchwork of complicated Federal controls and regulations.
Therefore, today I request that the Congress enact the "Child Nutrition Re-
form Act of 1976."
This legislation would:
-Provide financial assistance to States based on the cost of feeding all needy
children.
-Consolidate 15 complex categorical and overlapping programs into a single
block grant to States, increasing their flexibility in administering these pro-
grams, and at the same time save the taxpayers nearly $900 million in FY
1977 by reducing assistance to non-needy children.
-Remove unnecessary restrictions and red tape governing the way meals
are provided to needy children.
-Give concerned organizations and individuals in each State an oppor-
tunity to be involved in the planning of child feeding programs.
