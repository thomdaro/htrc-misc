Gerald R. Ford, 1976
North Vietnam on behalf of trying to get more information concerning the
MIA's. That congressional committee has come to the White House, talked
with me, and urged that we undertake informal discussions primarily aimed
at the MIA problem and anything that might relate to it. And that is the limit
of the discussions so far.
Q. Would you favor that?
THE PRESIDENT. I certainly favor it, if it can have any impact or beneficial
results involving our MIA's.
Q. Mr. President, how are you signaling this to the North Vietnamese?
THE PRESIDENT. Through proper channels.
Q. Mr. President, can you conceive of any situation in which this country
might conduct a blockade?
The President. I would not want to speculate on any military action that
we might undertake. We will take appropriate action.
Q. Mr. President, as primaries go, how important is the California primary?
The President. Every primary is important, and we have taken one at a
time.
Thank you very, very much.
REPORTER. Thank you, Mr. President.
NOTE: The exchange began at 10:18 a.m. at the Coast Guard Air Station, San Francisco International
Airport.

Remarks in San Francisco at the Annual National
Convention of the American Textile Manufacturers
Institute. March 26, 1976
Thank you very, very much, John, members and guests of the American Textile
Manufacturers Institute:
It is good to see you all here, and I am deeply grateful that you made some
room in your busy schedule for my opportunity to say hello to so many of you
that I have known over the years. It is good to see old friends and to say hello to
new ones. I could not be inâ€”as a matter of fact, John, I just could not be in San
Francisco for a bit today without stopping by for a few minutes on this occasion
of your 27th annual meeting.
It also gives me an opportunity to personally extend my very best wishes to
Bob Jackson on his retirement as your executive vice president. As I said in my
807
