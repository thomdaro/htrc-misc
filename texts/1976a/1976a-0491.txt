STATE AND LOCAL DECISIONMAKING
Q. Thank you, Mr. President.
I am very much concerned about the rules and regulations that override
our State laws. The people who make the rules and regulations are not answer-
able to our people because they are not elected officials. Is there some way that
you could set up a legislative subcommittee to oversee the rules and regula-
tions or get their approval before they are finally made?
THE PRESIDENT. Well, I am sure you are familiar with the fact that under
our system of government of checks and balances the President can't tell
the Congress to establish a committee or a subcommittee. They are a separate
and coordinate branch of our government. In fact, they would probably do
just the opposite if I recommended it. If you recommended it, they might pro-
ceed with it. No, I am being very serious. I don't think that the Federal Govern-
mentâ€”and I can only speak for the Federal Government-should override
responsible local or State decisions. And frankly, that is one of the reasons why
I have tried so hard to get the Congress to move from categorical grant pro-
grams, where some bureaucrat in Washington makes the decision and over-
rides the decisionmaking process of a local official or a State official. And
under the program where I recommend taking Federal money and giving
it to the local officials and State officials, then you don't have some bureaucrat
in Washington making the decision; you have the process handled right here
in Keene or Manchester or Portsmouth or Conway or any one of the other
places.
Thank you all. It's a great pleasure to see you. Good luck to you.
NOTE: The President spoke at 7:42 p.m. at Keene
