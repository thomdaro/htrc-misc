Public Papers of the Presidents
-In food and drug safety, I have asked for $226 million in 1977, an increase
of $17 million, to enable further progress in priority areas;
—In the area of drug abuse prevention, I propose almost $500 million for pre-
vention and treatment to expand national drug abuse treatment capacity
to meet the current need;
-My budget requests more than $3 billion for health research, including con-
tinued support of major national efforts in cancer and heart disease research
and support for new scientific opportunities in the fields of environmental
health, aging, and immunology;
-In our effort to improve the training and utilization of doctors and other
health professionals, I have requested new legislation and funding of $319
million, designed to concentrate on the problems of geographic and spe-
cialty maldistribution of health professionals;
-To assist local communities to attract physicians, dentists and other health
professionals to underserved areas, I am proposing to expand the National
Health Service Corps demonstration program 38% from $18 million to
$25 million;
-To assist the development of a strong health maintenance alternative, I have
directed HEW to move rapidly in administering the dual option provisions
of the HMO Act. And, to complete the 5-year effort to demonstrate and test
the health maintenance organization concept, I have requested an additional
year's authorization for new commitments. As of last June, there were 10
health maintenance organizations certified through the dual option
provisions;
-To provide improved health services to American Indians and Alaska Na-
tives, I am asking for $355 million. Spending by the Indian Health Service
alone in 1977 will result in over $685 per beneficiary, or over $2,740 per
Indian family of four;
—In the area of veterans' health care, I have requested $4.5 billion to assure
continued quality care by providing for increases in medical staff and re-
search related to VA health care delivery.
A realistic assessment of the present health care programs and the responsibili-
ties of Federal, State, and local governments fully demonstrates that the reforms
I am proposing in Federal health care are needed now. The Medicare Improve-
ments of 1976 that I recommended to the Congress on February 11 also repre-
sents a balanced response to needed program reforms. This proposal is designed
to improve catastrophic health cost protection for our aged and disabled, re-
