Martin Luther King, Jr. January 14, 1976
ON THE occasion of the 47th anniversary of the birth of Dr. Martin Luther
King, Jr., the Nation is once again reminded of his eloquent commitment to
the cause of civil rights and of his forceful leadership in that cause.
As we observe this anniversary, our thoughts are with his family. We also
pledge our renewed dedication to the struggle for equality and well-being for
all our citizens, to which Dr. King so courageously devoted his life.

the Government and people of Malaysia.
I have designated our Ambassador to Malaysia, Francis T. Underhill, Jr.,
