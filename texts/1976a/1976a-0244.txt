Message to the Senate Transmitting the United States-Spain
Extradition Treaty. February 3, 1976
To the Senate of the United States:
With a view to receiving the advice and consent of the Senate to ratification,
I transmit herewith a supplementary treaty on extradition between the United
States and Spain, signed at Madrid on January 25, 1975.
The supplementary treaty modifies our treaty on extradition with Spain by
increasing from 30 to 45 days the period of time during which a person may be
provisionally arrested and detained pending presentation, through diplomatic
channels, of documents in support of an extradition request. This change is in
keeping with modern extradition treaties and is intended to prevent the release
of an arrested person for lack of properly prepared extradition papers.
I transmit also for the information of the Senate the report of the Depart-
ment of State with respect to this supplementary treaty.
I recommend that the Senate give early and favorable consideration to the
supplementary treaty, and give its advice and consent to ratification.
The White House,
GERALD R. FORD
