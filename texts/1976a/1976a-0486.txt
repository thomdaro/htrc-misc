Public Papers of the Presidents
THE PRESIDENT. We have excellent relations with the Chinese Nationalist
Government. I have been there. I know their top people. It has been a good
ally. We have a defense treaty with them. They are good friends, and we are
going to stick by them.
Q. When are you going to visit them again?
THE PRESIDENT. Well, I am pretty busy right now. [Laughter]

REFLECTIONS ON THE PRESIDENCY
THE PRESIDENT. One more and then we'll quit.

if you would rather have another job, and why?
THE PRESIDENT. Well, I really enjoy the job. I enjoy the challenge. I get up

but I like to stay and get the job done every day. It's a great challenge because
we have problems, but they are solvable, and I enjoy the opportunity to work
with people in trying to solve those problems. And I like the job, and that is
why I am a candidate, and that is why I would appreciate your support next
Tuesday and on November 2.
Thank you very much.

and stayed here, and it gives me great pleasure to present the President of the
United States. [Laughter]
THE PRESIDENT. Those are kinder words than she usually gives me. [Laughter]
Let me thank you all for coming, staying, and it is a great privilege and
pleasure for both Betty and myself to come and see you all firsthand. And if I
don't violate the rules of the house, can I take a couple of questions here? I'd
be delighted to.
FEDERAL BUDGET
Q. Mr. President, what plans do you have for the next 4 years to balance
