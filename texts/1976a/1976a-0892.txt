transaction. The act currently prohibits discrimination on the basis of sex or

This bill carries out my recommendations. It applies to business as well as
consumer credit transactions and, thus, reaches discrimination against Ameri-
cans in the extension of credit which might arise from foreign boycott practices.
In addition, this bill permits the Attorney General, as well as private citizens,
to initiate suits where discrimination in credit transactions has occurred. It also

It is with great pleasure that I sign a bill that represents a major step forward
in assuring equal opportunity in our country.

I believe that the Federal government has a responsibility to provide nutrition
assistance to those most in need. At the same time, I believe that the existing
