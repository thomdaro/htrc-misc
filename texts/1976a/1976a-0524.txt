Message to the Congress Transmitting Annual Report of the
National Science Board. February 23, 1976
To the Congress of the United States:
I am pleased to submit to the Congress the Seventh Annual Report of the
National Science Board entitled, "Science Indicators 1974." It has been pre-
pared in accordance with Section 4(g) of the National Science Foundation Act,
as amended by Public Law 90–407.
This report is a part of a continuing effort by the National Science Board to
develop a statistical and comparative picture of the status of American science
and technology. On balance, the data in this report and other evidence indicate
that the nation's research and development enterprise continues to be produc-
tive and competitive. The report also shows the unfortunate fact that inflation
and the recent recession have affected adversely the level of effort and the re-
sources that are devoted to the nation's research and development activities—
much the same as other programs have been affected. Fortunately, we are mak-
ing solid progress in correcting these problems and the prospects for the future
are very good.
The nation's research and development efforts are important to the growth of
our economy, the future welfare of our citizens, and the maintenance of a
strong defense. The nation must also have a strong effort in basic research to
provide the new knowledge which is essential for scientific and technological
progress. My 1977 Budget now before the Congress reflects my views on the im-
portance of science and technology in achieving our national objectives.
I commend this report to your attention.
The White House,
February 23, 1976.
GERALD R. FORD
