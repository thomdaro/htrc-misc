Remarks at a President Ford Committee Fundraising
Dinner in Los Angeles, California. March 26, 1976
Thank you very, very much, John, Ed Carter, my good, former friends in the
Congress-Clair Burgener, John Rousselot, and Chuck Wiggins-Ev Younger,
Bus Mosbacher, Your Eminence, and Rabbi Magnin:
Let me, at the outset, express my deepest appreciation to Cary Grant, to Leona
Mitchell and to Howard Keel. If I had had my preference, I wish all three
would have extended their time about three times. I would have enjoyed it a
great deal more.
May I say to Cary that I really enjoyed his performance as master of cere-

but he has moved up very, very rapidly in the television business. He has a show
on Saturday nights at 11:30, and the principal theme of his performance is

And he struck on a responsive chord a few months ago when there were some
comments concerning my alleged clumsiness, and he has made a pretty good
profession out of it. [Laughter] But, anyhow, last night, when he was intro-
duced, there was a big audience in Washington, D.C., and he makes his entry
down a center aisle and he stumbles all over as he finally gets up to the ros-
trum here, and he falls and, well, it goes on for about 5 minutes or moreâ€”
-it
seemed like an hour. [Laughter]
But we were prepared for him. And if I may take a minute, we had some
suspicion that he might do just this. So, we had a false tablecloth sitting where
I was sitting, and he was on the other side during the evening meal, and we had
