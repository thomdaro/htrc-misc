We Americans will remember him especially for the role he played in build-
ing a new relationship between the People's Republic of China and the United
States. We are confident that this relationship will continue to develop on the
foundation of understanding and cooperation which he helped to establish.
The United States offers its condolences to the Government and people of the
People's Republic of China.
NOTE: Chou En-lai was Premier from 1949 until his death in Peking on January 8.

Memorandum on Appointing the Chairman of
the Interdepartmental Savings Bonds
Committee. January 9, 1976
[Dated January 8, 1976. Released January 9, 1976]
Memorandum for the Heads of Departments and Agencies
I have appointed Secretary of Interior Thomas S. Kleppe as Chairman of the
Interdepartmental Savings Bonds Committee.
The Savings Bonds Program constitutes the least inflationary way the Treas-
ury can borrow to finance Federal programs. More than $67 billion in Savings
Bonds are held by Americans. This is over 20 percent of the privately held
portion of the public debt.
It is entirely appropriate that Federal employees take leadership responsibility
in the furtherance of the Savings Bonds Program through the Payroll Savings
Plan. We must set the example for all Americans to follow.
Secretary Kleppe and members of the Interdepartmental Savings Bonds Com-
mittee have a special duty to see that the Departments and Agencies which they
head achieve and maintain a high record of employee participation in the
Savings Bonds Program.
Secretary Kleppe has my full support as he undertakes this new responsibility.
I know he can count on your personal interest and cooperation.
