Message to the Senate Transmitting the United States-Israel
Convention on Income Tax. February 11, 1976
To the Senate of the United States:
I transmit herewith, for Senate advice and consent to ratification, the Con-
vention signed at Washington on November 20, 1975, between the Government
of the United States of America and the Government of the State of Israel with
respect to taxes on income. Also I desire to withdraw from the Senate the Con-
vention for the avoidance of double taxation and prevention of fiscal evasion
with respect to taxes on income between the Government of the United States.
of America and the Government of Israel which was signed at Washington on
June 29, 1965 (Executive F, 89th Congress, 1st Session).
There is no convention on this subject presently in force between the United
States and Israel.
The Convention signed on November 20, 1975, is similar in many essential
respects to other recent United States income tax treaties.
I also transmit, for the information of the Senate, the report of the Department
of State with respect to the Convention.
Conventions such as this one are an important element in promoting closer
economic cooperation between the United States and other countries. I urge the
Senate to act favorably on this Convention at an early date and to give its advice
and consent to ratification.
The White House,
February 11, 1976.
