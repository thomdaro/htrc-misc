Gerald R. Ford, 1976
support for the amendments to the Consumer Credit Protection Act which
would bar such discrimination.
The Consumer Credit Protection Act already on the books prohibits credit
discrimination based on sex and marital status. The amendments that I am
signing today broaden the act to prohibit credit discrimination on the basis
of race, color, religion, national origin, and age.
The other bill that I am signing today, the Consumer Leasing Act of 1976,
also broadens consumer protection. It amends the 1968 Truth in Lending
Act to extend to lease contracts, the disclosure and protection requirements
now imposed on credit transactions. With the rise of consumer leasing of
automobiles and other equipment as an alternative to installment buying, this
measure meets a very real need.
I am delighted to sign both bills today, and I congratulate the Members of
Congress, both Democrat and Republican, for their working with us on this
project. The bills add to a growing list of steps that we have taken in the last
year to help give all consumers a far fairer shake, to make our country far
more equitable and a more just place for all Americans to live.
I thank the Members of Congress and Mrs. Knauer for being here on this
beautiful day in the Rose Garden for this occasion.
NOTE: The President spoke at 2:07 p.m. at a
ceremony in the Rose Garden at the White House.
In his opening remarks, he referred to Virginia H.
Knauer, Special Assistant to the President for Con-
sumer Affairs.
As enacted, the Equal Credit Opportunity Act
Amendments of 1976 (H.R. 6516) is Public Law
94-239 (90 Stat. 251), and the Consumer Leasing
Act of 1976 (H.R. 8835) is Public Law 94-240
(90 Stat. 257). Both bills were approved March 23,
1976.

Statement on Signing the Equal Credit Opportunity Act
Amendments of 1976. March 23, 1976
I HAVE today signed H.R. 6516, which expands the scope of the Equal Credit
Opportunity Act.
This administration is committed to the goal of equal opportunity in all as-
pects of our society. In financial transactions, no person should be denied an
equal opportunity to obtain credit for reasons unrelated to his or her credit-
worthiness.
Last November, I stated my support for legislation to amend the Equal Credit
Opportunity Act to bar creditor discrimination on the basis of race, color, reli-
