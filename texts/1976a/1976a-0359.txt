Statement on the Birthday of Susan B. Anthony.
February 13, 1976
SUNDAY, February 15, is the birthday of Susan B. Anthony, who was born
on a Massachusetts farm in 1820.
From an early interest in the temperance, antislavery, and women's rights
movements of her day, Susan B. Anthony rose to meet the discrimination
of her day which denied women the right to vote.
With other dedicated women, she took the cause of women's suffrage to
State capitals across our growing Nation. Although her efforts brought only
limited success in her lifetime, the irreversible change she wrought in the
attitudes of society ultimately led to the ratification of the nineteenth amend-
ment to the U.S. Constitution.
As we engage in a continuation of her struggle to ensure legal equality
today, it is encouraging to remember her message to a 1906 women's suffrage
association banquet in Washington, D.C. She simply but eloquently said:
"Failure is impossible."
