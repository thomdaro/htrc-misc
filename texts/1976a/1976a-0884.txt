fiscal year.
It focuses very special attention on research and development for energy and
defense and our basic research. It continues or increases support in agriculture,
space, health, as well as other areas that show promise in meeting the challenges
that we face.
At the same time, we must make sure that we have scientific and technological
expertise at the highest levels of government. To do this, I have submitted legis-
lation to establish an Office of Science and Technology Policy in the Executive
Office of the President.
It is vital that the Congress act promptly and positively on this proposal and on
my 1977 fiscal year budget recommendations. Let us make certain that science,
engineering, and technology will continue to play a very major part in assuring
our future strength and prosperity.
It is a pleasure now to sign the message to the Congress and hopefullyâ€”and
I think we have good reason to believe that Congress will act on this legis-
lation and the office will be established as soon as the legislation has been
signed into law.
Thank you very much.
NOTE: The President spoke at 12:41 p.m. in the
Cabinet Room at the White House. In his opening
remarks, he referred to H. Guyford Stever, Director,
National Science Foundation.

In our recent history, the Nation has made major investments in research and
development activities to ensure their continued contribution to the growth of
