The President's News Conference of
April 2, 1976
THANK YOU very much, Mr. Thompson [Jack Thompson, president, Mil-
waukee Press Club]. If I could take one minute.
Flying out here this morning, I learned that the Department of Labor issued
some more good economic news. They indicated that the unemployment figure
went down again for the month of March to 7.5 percent. I ask you to compare
that with 8.9, as I recall, in May of 1975.
The most encouraging news was the fact that this report indicates that 86,700,-
000 people are gainfully employed—the highest number of people employed in
the history of the United States—and since March of last year, we have added
2,600,000 more jobs in the United States. So, we are making real progress in re-
ducing unemployment and, at the same time, increasing employment.
With that, I will be glad to answer any questions.
QUESTIONS
SCHOOL BUSING
[1.] Q. Mr. President, I've got two questions, if you will.
Milwaukee has been ordered to integrate its public schools. Do you have any
thoughts on how to achieve racial integration?
THE PRESIDENT. Well, I have always believed that the constitutional right of
equality must be protected by the courts of the land and by all other public
officials. On the other hand, I do not believe that court-ordered, forced busing
to achieve racial balance is the right way to get quality education.
We have ample evidence that in those instances where it has been applied—
court-ordered, forced busing-there has not been an increase in quality educa-
tion. It is my belief that there is a better way to improve educational opportuni-
ties and, at the same time, to improve the integration of our society as guaranteed
by the Constitution.
The Esch Amendment, which was passed by the Congress in 1974 and signed
by me, provides a series of steps whereby we can desegregate and, at the same
time, improve educational opportunity with an emphasis on the neighborhood
schools.
