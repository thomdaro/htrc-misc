Statement Announcing Expansion of the Foreign
Intelligence Advisory Board. March 9, 1976
TWO WEEKS ago, I announced to the Nation a comprehensive program to
strengthen the foreign intelligence agencies of the United States Government.
My actions were designed to achieve two basic objectives:
-First to ensure that we have the best possible information on which to base
our policies toward other nations;
â€”And second, to ensure that our foreign intelligence agencies do not infringe
on the rights of American citizens.
Today, as an additional part of this effort, I am announcing the expansion of
my Foreign Intelligence Advisory Board. This Board was set up in 1956 in
order to provide independent, nonpartisan advice on the effectiveness of the in-
telligence community in meeting the intelligence needs of the President. Since
1974, the Board has been composed of 10 members, all of whom are private
citizens.
I am announcing today that I am expanding the Board to 17 members, and I
am appointing the following members to the Board:
STEPHEN AILES
LESLIE C. ARENDS
ADM. GEORGE W. ANDERSON
WILLIAM O. BAKER
WILLIAM J. CASEY
LEO CHERNE
JOHN B. CONNALLY
GORDON GRAY
MELVIN LAIRD
EDWIN H. LAND
GEN. LYMAN L. LEMNITZER
CLARE BOOTHE LUCE
ROBERT MURPHY
EDWARD TELLER
EDWARD BENNETT WILLIAMS
JOHN S. FOSTER, JR.
ROBERT W. GALVIN
I am announcing my decision to have Leo Cherne serve as the new Chairman
of the Board.
