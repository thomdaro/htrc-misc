Gerald R. Ford, 1976
learn about it from childhood. And though I know there is still plenty left
for me to study, I feel confident that I can do a good job over there.
Q. Mrs. Armstrong, on the lower level of women in government, do you
think that we are doing any sort of a job in getting women appointed to
boards and commissions and that sort of thing?
MRS. ARMSTRONG. Well, I think that this President, and his wonderful
Betty—he claims she prods him—I think they have done a fine job. None of
us is ever satisfied that it comes fast enough. But yes, I think that great progress
has been made.
I remember when the President had faith in Carla Hills, that she could do
a fine job as a Cabinet member, as head of HUD. Her qualifications were ques-
tioned by a number of people at the time, but to me, the President's confidence
in her has been completely justified. I think she is doing a fine job.
THE PRESIDENT. I might add that, of course, we have as the head of the
NLRB, one of the most important agencies or commissions that we have in
the country is headed by Betty Murphy. And to put a woman in those very
delicate relationships between labor and management with the great respon-
sibility that the NLRB has, I think, proves our faith in persons such as Betty
Murphy. And I am certain that she has done a fine job and will continue to
do a fine job.
Q. Mr. President, how about in all those boards and commissions where
you named 17 men and 2 women?
THE PRESIDENT. I think we are doing quite well, Fran, and we are going to
continue to do better.
MRS. ARMSTRONG. Did you know that you are the only President to have
had two women in your Cabinet? We didn't overlap, but I was a member
of your Cabinet and Carla Hills is now.
THE PRESIDENT. Both very attractive, too.
It is nice to see you all.
REPORTER. Thank you.
NOTE: The President spoke at 10:45 a.m. in the Oval Office at the White House.
