Veto of a Public Works Employment Bill. February 13, 1976
To the House of Representatives:
I am returning without my approval H.R. 5247, the Public Works Employ-
ment Act of 1975.
Supporters of this bill claim that it represents a solution to the problem of un-
employment. This is simply untrue.
The truth is that this bill would do little to create jobs for the unemployed.
Moreover, the bill has so many deficiencies and undesirable provisions that it
would do more harm than good. While it is represented as the solution to our un-
employment problems, in fact it is little more than an election year pork barrel.
Careful examination reveals the serious deficiencies in H.R. 5247.
First, the cost of producing jobs under this bill would be intolerably high,
probably in excess of $25,000 per job.
Second, relatively few new jobs would be created. The bill's sponsors estimate
that H.R. 5247 would create 600,000 to 800,000 new jobs. Those claims are badly
exaggerated. Our estimates within the Administration indicate that at most
some 250,000 jobs would be created-and that would be over a period of several
years. The peak impact would come in late 1977 or 1978, and would come to no
more than 100,000 to 120,000 new jobs. This would represent barely a one tenth
of one percent improvement in the unemployment rate.
Third, this will create almost no new jobs in the immediate future, when those
jobs are needed. With peak impact on jobs in late 1977 or early 1978, this legisla-
tion will be adding stimulus to the economy at precisely the wrong time: when
the recovery will already be far advanced.
Fourth, Title II of the bill provides preferential treatment to those units of
government with the highest taxes without any distinction between those juris-
dictions which have been efficient in holding down costs and those that have not.
Fifth, under this legislation it would be almost impossible to assure taxpayers
that these dollars are being responsibly and effectively spent.
Effective allocation of over $3 billion for public works on a project-by-project
basis would take many months or years. The provision that project requests be
approved automatically unless the Commerce Department acts within 60 days
will preclude any useful review of the request, and prevent a rational allocation
of funds.
Sixth, this bill would create a new urban renewal program less than two years
