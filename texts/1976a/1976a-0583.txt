Gerald R. Ford, 1976
12-percent gain almost overnight. And if we just keep that momentum going,
it's bound to be in the right direction.
Q. Do you see the Florida primary being as close as New Hampshire?
THE PRESIDENT. I will predict it the way we did in New Hampshire, that we
are going to win. I am optimistic and very encouraged.
REPORTER. Thank you.
NOTE: The President spoke at 5:20 p.m. at the Spanish River Park. In his opening remarks, he referred to

Remarks in Boca Raton, Florida. February 28, 1976
MAYOR MARSHALL, I want to thank you, of course, for this warm welcome.
I want to thank that wonderful Boca Raton Band and those pretty girls. It's a
great band and thank you very much. I also wish to thank all of the wonderful
people who are here who have made this stop one of the finest, biggest, most
enthusiastic. It makes a long day seem very short and very, very worthwhile.
We have had a little rain, and I should apologize for my appearance, but
there's an old saying, you know, that aristocracy is of the soul, not of the cloth.
So, I don't look very good but I think I am a darned good President. And I want
you to know that the things we have done in the last 19 months have all been
plus, and the next 48 months are going to be more pluses.
I could quickly review, and I will. We have had bad inflation—12 or 14 per-
cent—and it is cut in half. We have gone through a recession, the worst since
the end of World War II. We are on the way out. Employment is going up;
unemployment is going down. Prices are going down, and we have a good start
on a healthy economy. And I ask you to give me a chance to make sure that it is
continued.
I ask for your help March 9, and once we win that, we are on our way to win
November 2.
Thank you very, very much.
NOTE: The President spoke at 5:53 p.m. at the Royal Park Shopping Center.
