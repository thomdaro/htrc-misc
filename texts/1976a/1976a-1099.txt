mer Intern Program. In addition, to assure that needy young people have the
opportunity to become involved, I am again setting a general goal of one needy
youth for every 40 regular employees.
Chairman Hampton of the Civil Service Commission will continue to pro-
vide guidance on all aspects of the Government's summer programs and will
report to me on accomplishments. In the past, the success of this program has
been the result of support by Federal managers. I urge your continued personal
involvement.

Letter to the President of the Senate on the Federal Summer
Employment for Youth and Public Service Jobs Programs.
April 8, 1976
Sir:
I ask the Congress to give immediate consideration to proposed supplemental
appropriations for the fiscal year 1976 in the amount of $528,420,000 for the De-
partment of Labor's summer youth employment program.
The details of this proposal are set forth in the enclosed letter from the Direc-
tor of the Office of Management and Budget. I concur with his comments and
observations.
I also remind the Congress that the $1.7 billion I requested in 1976 supple-
mental appropriations for temporary employment assistance is urgently needed
to prevent substantial layoffs from federally subsidized public service jobs by the
end of this fiscal year.
Respectfully,
[The President of the Senate]
