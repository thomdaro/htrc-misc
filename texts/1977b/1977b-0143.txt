Enforcement of Title VI of the
Civil Rights Act
Memorandum for the Heads of Executive
Departments and Agencies. July 20, 1977
Memorandum for the Heads of Executive
Departments and Agencies
Title VI of the Civil Rights Act of
1964 writes into law a concept which is
basic to our country-that the govern-
ment of all the people should not support
programs which discriminate on the
grounds of race, color, or national origin.
There are no exceptions to this rule; no
matter how important a program, no
matter how urgent the goals, they do not
excuse violating any of our laws--includ-
ing the laws against discrimination.
This Administration will enforce Title
VI. This means, first, that each of you
must exert firm leadership to ensure that
your department or agency enforces this
law.
Second, there must be central guid-
ance and oversight of Title VI enforce-
ment. Executive Order 11764 places
with the Attorney General the respon-
sibility for coordinating Title VI enforce-
ment and for approving rules, reg-
ulations and orders which departments
or agencies issue under Title VI. I want
the Attorney General to work closely
with each of you to help you make sure
