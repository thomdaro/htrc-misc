powerful weapons and also to prevent any
tests of atomic explosions. We want to pre-
vent nations which do not presently have
atomic explosions from desiring those ca-
pabilities. We want to reduce the sale of
conventional weapons to nations around
the world. And we want to seek in every
possible way closer communications, bet-
ter trade, closer friendship between our
countries.
Poland and your leaders have an ability
and experience to look knowledgeably
both to the East and to the West, and you
can contribute greatly to the mutual ef-
forts of ourselves and the Soviet Union
to reach those agreements which we both
desire.
The ancient alliance between the
United States and Poland in peace and
war has given our people good lives. We
have helped to establish and to maintain
the independence of one another. This
sharing of culture, blood kinship, and
close cooperation in the past can give us a
basis for even better future together.
I hope that at the earliest convenient
time we might be permitted to repay the
hospitality to your leaders, First Secretary
Gierek and others, that you have extended
to us on this visit. It is very valuable to
have Polish and American friendship
combined together to give us what all men
and women want-peace throughout the
world.
On behalf of the people of the United
States, I would like to propose a toast to
the indomitable spirit and to the freedom
of the Polish people, to your enlightened
leaders particularly First Secretary
Gierek and his wife-and to peace
throughout the world.
NOTE: The exchange began at 9:27 p.m. at
the Palace of the Council of Ministers. First
Secretary Gierek spoke in Polish, and his re-
marks were translated by an interpreter.
Following the dinner, the President met with
First Secretary Gierek at the Palace.
