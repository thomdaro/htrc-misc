Arab states make further progress in the
search for a lasting peace, it is essential
that the United States meet fully its
commitments under the Sinai II Agree-
ment. The Sinai Support Mission is an
important element in meeting these re-
sponsibilities, and I urge the Congress to
continue its support for this peacekeeping
mission.

National Farm-City Week, 1977
Proclamation 4533. October 20, 1977
By the President of the United States
of America
A Proclamation
One of our most important national
objectives is the establishment of a na-
tional food policy. This is vital to our own
welfare and security as well as to our
search for world peace. It requires the
mutual respect and intelligent coopera-
tion of all our people.
Once each family's farm supplied al-
most all of the raw materials and finished
products to feed, clothe and warm the
family. As our means of production have
progressed and farmers as well as fac-
tories and businesses have increasingly
specialized, each family has come to de-
pend on many others for the tools and
equipment and materials to keep our com-
plex system running and meet our indi-
vidual daily needs.
Our production of food is the marvel of
the world. It depends on not only our
farmers, but also researchers, the makers
and sellers of equipment and supplies and
the providers of services to farms and
farmers, and those who transport, process
and sell our harvests. All are vital links in
maintaining the wholesomeness, abun-
dance and availability at reasonable cost
of our varied food supply. Many of the
links in this food chain are in distant
cities. All of us, on farms, in cities and
suburbs, are consumers of these vital
products.
Now, THEREFORE, I, JIMMY CARTER,
President of the United States of Amer-
ica, do hereby proclaim the period of
November 18 through November 24,
1821
