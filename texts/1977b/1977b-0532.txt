Federal Civilian and Military
Pay Increases
Message to the Congress. September 29, 1977
To the Congress of the United States:
In accordance with the provisions of
section 5305 of title 5 of the United States
Code, I hereby report on the compara-
bility adjustment I am ordering for the
Federal statutory pay systems in October
1977.
The Secretary of Labor, the Director
of the Office of Management and Budget
and the Chairman of the United States
Civil Service Commission, who serve
jointly as my agent for Federal pay, have
proposed a 7.05 percent across-the-board
increase in pay rates for the Federal statu-
tory pay systems. The Advisory Commit-
tee on Federal Pay has concurred with
this recommendation.
While the Federal Employees Pay
Council recommended a larger increase, I
have decided that the 7.05 percent in-
crease fully satisfies the principles set
forth in the Federal Pay Comparability
Act of 1970 that Federal salaries be com-
parable with those in private enterprise
for the same levels of work.
I am transmitting herewith the reports
of my Pay Agent and the Advisory Com-
mittee, as well as a copy of the Executive
order I have promulgated to put this pay
adjustment into effect.
The White House,
September 29, 1977.

Military Pay Increase
Message to the Congress. September 29, 1977
To the Congress of the United States:
In accord with 37 U.S.C. 1009 (c), I
am hereby advising the Congress that I
plan to exercise the discretionary author-
ity provided by 37 U.S.C. 1009 (c), as
added by section 303 of the Department
of Defense Appropriation Authorization
Act, 1977 (Public Law 94-361), with
respect to adjustments in the levels of
compensation for the members of the
uniformed services.
The amendments to 37 U.S.C. 1009
made by that act provide discretionary
authority to apply the adjustments (based
on the overall average percentage increase
in General Schedule rates of basic pay, in
accord with 37 U.S.C. 1009 (a)) to the
basic pay, quarters allowances and sub-
sistence allowances of the uniformed serv-
ices on a percentage basis other than an
equal percentage basis. Those amend-
ments also provide discretionary authority
to pay a partial quarters allowance to
bachelors in government quarters, on field
duty and on sea duty.
The current levels of the military al-
lowances for quarters and for subsistence
