Dear Senator Byrd:
I have sent the enclosed letter to Speak-
er O'Neill about my concern that over
one-half billion dollars may be wasted on
unneeded B-1 bombers and Minuteman
III missiles.
I hope that you and the Senate will
assist me in this effort to avoid unneeded
spending.
Sincerely,
JIMMY CARTER

American Education
Week, 1977
Proclamation 4529. September 30, 1977
By the President of the United States
of America
A Proclamation
At the base of any democracy must lie
a commitment to education for all.
Americans, accordingly, have an enor-
mous stake in the vitality of our schools.
Parents, instead of being strangers to
the classrooms in which their children
spend so much of their lives, must become
partners with teachers.
But parents and teachers cannot do the
job alone. In our attitudes and our ac-
tions, in a hundred different ways, each
of us influences young people toward edu-
cation or away from it. This is the sig-
nificance of this year's theme for Ameri-
can Education Week: "Working Togeth-
er for Education".
By sharing our expertise and interests
with the schools, we can all enrich edu-
cational programs and help determine the
course along which our young people will
lead America in the years to come.
Now, THEREFORE, I, JIMMY CARTER,
President of the United States of Amer-
ica, do hereby designate the week begin-
ning November 13, 1977, as American
Education Week.
I ask every American to consider how
he or she can work with our Nation's edu-
cational community to help America pre-
pare its youngsters to meet the responsi-
bilities they will some day assume.
IN WITNESS WHEREOF, I have here-
unto set my hand this thirtieth day of
September, in the year of our Lord nine-
teen hundred seventy-seven, and of the
Independence of the United States of
America the two hundred and second.
