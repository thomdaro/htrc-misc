United States-United
Kingdom Reciprocal Fisheries
Agreement
Message to the Senate Transmitting the
Agreement. October 7, 1977
To the Senate of the United States:
I am pleased to transmit for the advice
and consent of the Senate to ratification
the Reciprocal Fisheries Agreement be-
tween the Government of the United
States of America and the Government of
the United Kingdom of Great Britain and
Northern Ireland. The Agreement was
signed, and an accompanying Agreed
Minute initialed, in Washington, D.C. on
June 24, 1977.
The Agreement provides United States
commercial fishermen access to the new
200 mile fishery zone of the British Virgin
Islands and commercial fishermen of the
British Virgin Islands access to the 200
mile United States fishery conservation
zone. It secures the United States objec-
tive of providing for U.S. commercial
fishermen the opportunity to continue
fishing at traditional levels in areas which
have recently become subject to the fishery
jurisdiction of the British Virgin Islands.
The Agreement reflects the close ties
which exist in the Caribbean area be-
tween the United States and the British
Virgin Islands.
I also transmit for the information of
the Senate the report of the Department
of State with respect to the Agreement.
I urge the Senate to consider the
Agreement at an early date and to give
its advice and consent to ratification.
