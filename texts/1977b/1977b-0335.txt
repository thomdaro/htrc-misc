Daniel "Chappie‚Äù James, Jr.,
Airmen and Industrial Museum
Message for the Groundbreaking in
Tuskeegee, Alabama. August 19, 1977
A museum on the grounds of old Tus-
keegee Airbase, where black airmen and
support troops trained in World War II,
is a useful and long overdue tribute to
the sacrifice of these brave men. It is
highly appropriate that the Air and In-
dustrial Museum is being named for Gen.
Daniel "Chappie" James Jr., who has
served his country with such distinction.
Despite segregation at the time, the black
troops who trained here compiled an
honorable record. Wallace and Wallace
Chemical and Oil Corp. is to be com-
mended for setting aside this museum
area in their honor and for its plan to
restore planes and equipment of the era
so that future generations will better
understand the contribution of black serv-
icemen who fought and died for their
country, and black industrialists and
others who have contributed to the na-
tion's economic well-being.
