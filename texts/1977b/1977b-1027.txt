MR. CARTER. On this farm thing, you
know, they came over here; couldn't get
anybody to give them a welcome. I went
over there.
THE PRESIDENT. I am glad you did.
I mentioned you in my press conference.
MR. CARTER. I know you did. I heard
it. That's great. But, you know, I knew
you were for them, but it was hard for
me to-they were a little angry, you
know. They wanted you down here. They
started shouting, you know, "We want
Jimmy. We want Jimmy. Where's
Jimmy?"
THE PRESIDENT. [Inaudible]-going to
hear about the letter to the farmer. I
know they have got the headlines in the
Columbus paper. I just wonder if they got
it in the Atlanta paper. Have you looked
at it?
MR. CARTER. I haven't gone through
this yet. I just got it. You want to look
at it?
THE PRESIDENT. No, I don'tâ€”there it
is. I just wanted to be sure it was cov-
ered.
I got a letter from a woman in Baxley,
a widow, and she and her young son run
the farm. So, I just sent her-the paper
says a seven-page telegram explaining the
I felt about the farm program.
way
The new bill that we passed didn't go
into effect until October, and it will take
care of a lot of our problems. Of course,
we have still got a serious problem when
we don't make a crop. And land prices,
as you know, have leveled off. They were
going up 10 to 15 percent a year, which
kept prices going up. They have kind of
leveled off. And there's also, you know,
farmers have got a tremendous capital in-
vestment, much more than the average
businessman.
MR. CARTER. Well, that's true. Another
thing, you know, Jimmy, some of them
need to keep their cool. You know, a lot
of them are getting mad, and I think this
is wrong.
THE PRESIDENT. I think they had some
violence in Texas.
MR. CARTER. I know. I saw it on TV
last night.
THE PRESIDENT. As long as the farm-
ers let consumers know they have got a
problem, that's good. But if they ever turn
the consumers against them, they will be
worse off than they were before. What's
best for the consumers is to have the
family farmers strong and have a sound
financial base to keep prices from fluctu-
ating so wildly.

REPORTER. Mr. President, what is the
story about the OPEC decision this morn-
ing?
THE PRESIDENT. I'm just glad that
they decided to freeze the price, and I
hope it will be for the whole year of 1978.
