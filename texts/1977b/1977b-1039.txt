Administration of Jimmy Carter, 1977
Dec. 28
China has invited a bipartisan congres-
sional delegation to visit China during
January.
The delegation will depart January 2
and return January 17. The group will be
led by Senator Alan Cranston, Democrat
of California,
with Representative
Charles Whalen, Republican of Ohio, as
the deputy leader.
Other members of the group include:
Senators
CHARLES MATHIAS (R-Md.)
JAMES ABOUREZK (D-S. Dak.)
GARY HART (D-Colo.)
RICHARD LUGAR (R-Ind.)
Representatives
JAMES WEAVER (D-Oreg.)
STEPHEN NEAL (D-N.C.)
FREDERICK RICHMOND (D-N.Y.)
STEPHEN SOLARZ (D-N.Y.)
The Congressmen will be accompanied
by Allyn Kreps, legislative assistant to
Senator Cranston; Douglas Bennet, As-
sistant Secretary of State for Congres-
sional Relations; Dan Tate, Deputy Di-
rector of the White House congressional
liaison office; and Herbert Horowitz of
the Department of State.
Since the first congressional delegation
went to the People's Republic of China
in 1972, there have been over 70 Mem-
bers of Congress who have visited China.
The present delegation was scheduled
to visit China last November, but the
continuation of the congressional session
forced postponement of the original tim-
ing.
The exchange relationship fulfills that
part of the Shanghai Communique in
which both sides pledged to foster broader
understanding and engage in cultural
and scientific exchanges.
