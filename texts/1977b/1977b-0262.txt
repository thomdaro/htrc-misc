Administration of Jimmy Carter, 1977
own administration. And I hope that it
will light the way to a better energy solu-
tion for this Nation.
REPRESENTATIVE BROOKS. Mr. Presi-
dent, organization is really policy. You
have a great energy program, but it is
absolutely essential that you have in place
an organization that can make it work.
Under your leadership and that of Dr.
Schlesinger, I am confident that we will
start on the solution of all our energy
problems.
THE PRESIDENT. We've got a long way
to go on the energy policy, but I want to
express my thanks at this moment to the
House and Senate for the superb work
they are already doing in this difficult
area.
I believe that before the Congress
adjourns, hopefully in October, that we
will have an energy policy to make our
Nation proud. And I want to express my
thanks to you,
Senator Byrd, and to others.
