Administration of Jimmy Carter, 1977
Sept. 14
day, October 24, 1977, as Veterans Day
in a manner that will let our Nation's
veterans know that their sacrifices are and
always will be recognized and appre-
ciated.
I urge
the conduct of public cere-
monies, the visible tribute of members of
the business community, and the per-
sonal participation of all Americans of all
ages in honoring our Nation's veterans.
I especially encourage remembrance to
those men and women who are sick and
disabled and to those who are patients in
our hospitals.
I call upon Federal, State and local gov-
ernment officials to mark Veterans Day
by displaying the flag of the United States
and by supporting and encouraging public
involvement in appropriate exercises and
programs.
IN WITNESS WHEREOF, I have here-
unto set my hand this thirteenth day of
September, in the year of our Lord nine-
teen hundred and seventy-seven, and of
the Independence of the United States of
America the two hundred and second.
