Administration of Jimmy Carter, 1977
Dec. 14
But there has been a major obstacle to
the healthy growth of these clinics in the
areas that need them: That is the failure
of public and private health insurance
programs to support them. The legisla-
tion I am signing today will correct this
defect in our public health insurance pro-
grams, by requiring that the Medicare
and Medicaid programs pay for the serv-
ices of physician assistants and nurse prac-
titioners in clinics in rural areas without
adequate care. This reform will guar-
antee greater financial stability for clinics
already in existence and help establish
new clinics where they are needed most.
This legislation also establishes demon-
stration projects for reimbursing clinics
in urban areas. We must keep in mind
that many of our inner city residents also
lack access to adequate health care.
This bill has come to my desk after ex-
ceptionally close and fruitful cooperation
between several committees of Congress.
In the Senate, Chairman Herman Tal-
madge and his colleagues on the Finance
Health Subcommittee did a fine job in
expediting this legislation. In addition,
I'd like to commend Senators Jennings
Randolph, Bill Hathaway, Dick Clark,
and Patrick Leahy for their early and
consistent work on this measure. In the
House, Chairman Dan Rostenkowski of
the Ways and Means Health Subcom-
mittee and Chairman Paul Rogers of the
Interstate and Foreign Commerce Health
Subcommittee and their colleagues
worked closely to produce this measure.
In addition, I would like to express my
appreciation to the chairmen of the two
full House committees, Al Ullman and
Harley Staggers. Congressman Bill Brod-
head was also very helpful in securing
the passage of this legislation.
NOTE: As enacted, H.R. 8422 is Public Law
95-210, approved December 13.
