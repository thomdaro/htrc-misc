the Italian desk at the State Department body. Do you have any questions? [Laugh-

ARMS AND WEAPONS
Q. Mr. President, how do you reconcile
your decision to go ahead with the neutron
bomb with your inaugural pledge to elimi-
nate all nuclear weapons? Also, why
didn't you know the money was in the
bill? And three, doesn't this escalate the
arms race? And I have a followup.
[Laughter]
THE PRESIDENT. Well, it's a very serious
Foreign Policy at the Foreign Service question. In the first place, I did not know
Institute.
Wilkowski was assistant chief of the
economic section in Rome from 1963 to
1966 and deputy chief of mission in Tegu-
cigalpa, Honduras, from 1966 to 1970.
In 1970 and 1971, she was counselor for
commercial affairs in Rome, and in 1971
she was chief of the U.S. delegation to
the Inter-American Commission of Wom-
what was in the bill. The enhanced radia-
tion of the neutron bomb has been dis-
cussed and also has been under develop-
ment for 15 or 20 years. It's not a new
concept at all, not a new weapon.
It does not affect our SALT or strategic
weapons negotiations at all. It's strictly
designed as a tactical weapon. I think that
this would give us some flexibility.
