Administration of Jimmy Carter, 1977
Sept. 6
plans are for an increase in human free-
doms in the future.
But I think that he can describe plans
for the future better than can I. He knows
that this is a very serious problem for
Chile.
Q. Would you send observers?
THE PRESIDENT. No, we would not send
observers. I think the observers that
might by the way, Assistant Secretary
Todman was there recently-and the ob-
servers that we talked about would be
from the United Nations.
Thank
you very much.
Q. What do you say to people who say
you shouldn't meet with these dictators?
In other words, is there a problem meet-
ing with people who have bad reputa-
tions?
THE PRESIDENT. Well, no, I don't feel
that this should be an obstacle to my
meeting with them, to describing to them
the problems as I see them, to ask for
their explanation in a very frank and
forthcoming way and to request their
plans for the alleviation of the problem
or the explanation of the charges that
have been made against their govern-
ments.
Obviously, the question of human
rights has historically been a serious one
in this hemisphere, Latin America in
particular.
Most of the leaders have expressed to
me great satisfaction at the progress that
is now being made. Even when free elec-
tions do not exist, the commitments have
been made among the leaders with whom
I have met today that within a certain pe-
riod of time and a date set by them that
free elections would be held.
So, I think that my meeting with lead-
ers of countries where human rights
questions or others do exist-excessive
armaments, border disputes, drug supply
problems-I think it's healthy for them
and for us, for me to know their position
better and for them to have the encour-
agement of our expressions of concern.
I think it's a good thing. Thank you.
NOTE: The exchange began at 7 p.m. on the
South Grounds of the White House.
