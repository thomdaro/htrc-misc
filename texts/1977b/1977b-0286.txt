Administration of Jimmy Carter, 1977
announcements printed elsewhere in the
issue are not included.
There is no doubt that the steel indus-
try has experienced sharp increases in
costs. Despite rapid price increases, prof- July 30
itability in the steel industry remains
weak.
Nevertheless, the continuation of the
kind of price and cost increases that we
have been witnessing in one of our most
basic industries clearly jeopardizes our ef-
forts to achieve a deceleration in the over-
all rate of inflation. A steel industry able
to produce steel at low cost, using the
most modern techniques, is important to
the overall well-being of the United
States.
I am therefore directing the Council
on Wage and Price Stability to begin im-
mediately an updated study of prices,
costs, and general economic conditions in
the steel industry. I expect the Council to
report to me by September 30, 1977. In its
report the Council should pay particular
attention to:
(1) identifying the sources and reasons
for increasing costs in the steel
industry.
(2) examining the impact of Federal
policies on steel costs, prices, and
economic conditions facing the in-
dustry.
(3) actions which the Federal Govern-
ment might take to moderate cost
and price pressures in this in-
dustry.
