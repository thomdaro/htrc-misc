Nonfuel Minerals Policy
Announcement of a Cabinet-level,
Interagency Study. December 12, 1977
The White House today announced a
Cabinet-level, interagency study of non-
fuel minerals policy. The study, to be
chaired by Interior Secretary Cecil D.
Andrus, will consider international and
domestic minerals supply and demand
and the economic health of the minerals
industry. It will focus on the most critical
minerals.
The Cabinet-level coordinating com-
mittee will submit policy options and
recommendations to the President within
15 months. The study was initiated by the
President in response to congressional
and public concerns.
Members of the coordinating commit-
tee will be the Secretaries of the Interior,
State, the Treasury, Commerce, and
Energy; the Administrators of EPA and
GSA; the Director of the National Science
Foundation; the Assistant to the President
for National Security Affairs; the Chair-
man of the Council of Economic Advisers;
the Special Representative for Trade Ne-
gotiations; the Chairman of the Council
on Environmental Quality; the Director
of OMB; and the Director of the Office
of Science and Technology Policy.
Some of the concerns to be addressed
by the study are whether the trends to-
ward international interdependence and
the politicization of certain minerals
markets are increasing U.S. vulnerability
to foreign supply curtailments and price
manipulations; whether U.S. reserves,
production capacities, and inventories are
adequate to deal with possible supply/
price interruptions, or with the economic
and social consequences of such disrup-
tions; whether the economic health of the
domestic minerals industry is adequate;
and whether land use decisions are based
on adequate minerals information and
analysis.
The study will be the first to use the
Domestic Policy Review system, a process
designed to ensure high-level, interagency
consideration of important issues.
