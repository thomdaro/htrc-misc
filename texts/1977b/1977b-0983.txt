Thank you. Merry Christmas, every-
body.
This is a time of year when we try to
forget our worries and our tribulations,
our arguments and our differences, our
doubts and fears about the future, and
look on the positive side of life.
We try to search for confidence and for
security. We try to reach out our hands to
our friends, those whom we see every
day and those whom we tend to forget
during the rest of the year.
