Nov. 23
Administration of Jimmy Carter, 1977
Wright Brothers Day, 1977
Proclamation 4541. November 23, 1977
By the President of the United States
of America
A Proclamation
The era of modern aviation began near
Kitty Hawk, North Carolina, on Decem-
ber 17, 1903, when Wilbur and Orville
Wright, bicycle makers and inventors,
made the first successful flight in a
heavier-than-air, powered aircraft.
The achievement of the two brothers,
almost unnoticed at the time, has since
been recognized as one of history's most
significant accomplishments. Trips that
once took months now take a few hours
and all the peoples of the earth have be-
come neighbors.
It is particularly appropriate to remem-
ber this first powered flight during 1977,
the 50th anniversary of Charles A. Lind-
bergh's solo, nonstop trans-Atlantic flight
on a plane, the "Spirit of St. Louis",
which was powered by a Wright Whirl-
wind engine.
To commemorate the historic achieve-
ments of the Wright brothers, the Con-
gress, by a joint resolution of December
17, 1963 (77 Stat. 402, 36 U.S.C. 169),
designated the seventeenth day of Decem-
ber of each year as Wright Brothers Day
and requested the President to issue an-
nually a proclamation inviting people of
the United States to observe that day with
appropriate ceremonies and activities.
Now, THEREFORE, I, JIMMY CARTER,
President of the United States of Amer-
ica, do hereby call upon the people of this
Nation, and their local and national gov-
ernment officials, to observe Wright
Brothers Day, December 17, 1977, with
appropriate ceremonies and activities,
both to recall the accomplishments of the
Wright brothers and to provide a stimulus
to aviation in this country and through-
out the world.
IN WITNESS WHEREOF, I have here-
unto set my hand this twenty-third day of
November, in the year of our Lord nine-
teen hundred seventy-seven, and of the In-
dependence of the United States of Amer-
ica the two hundred and second.
JIMMY CARTER

GI Bill Improvement Act
of 1977
Statement on Signing H.R. 8701 Into Law.
November 23, 1977
I am pleased to sign into law today
H.R. 8701, the GI Bill Improvement Act
of 1977, a measure providing expanded
benefits for Vietnam era veterans. This
measure includes a 6.6-percent increase
in monthly educational assistance benefits
retroactive to October 1. It will mean
larger checks for the approximately
1,700,000 individuals who will train dur-
ing this fiscal year under the GI bill and
the Survivors' Educational Assistance Act.
Monthly benefits for a single veteran will
increase to $311; a married veteran will
receive $370; a married veteran with a
child will receive $422.
The VA work-study allowances are in-
creased under this measure, as are special
tutorial assistance provisions for veterans
having academic difficulties.
This bill is also designed to help vet-
erans attending high-tuition schools by
liberalizing the VA direct low-interest ed-
ucational loan program and increasing it
from $1,500 to $2,500 per school year.
