analysis.
URBAN POLICY
Q. Mr. President, last week you visited
the South Bronx and took a tour of that
area. Right now you have a task force
under Mrs. Harris developing an urban
policy. Sir, did your visit to the South
Bronx and what you saw there-the
vacant buildings and the unemployed
people have any impact
people—have
on your
thoughts on what kind of urban policy we
should have and what you are going to
present to the Congress?
THE PRESIDENT. Yes, it certainly did
have an impact on me and my own con-
science. It was not the first time I had
been to the South Bronx. I went there as
a candidate.
And I think it's important in two
ways-three ways. One is to let me un-
derstand, personally, the devastation in
the South Bronx, and similar places like
it throughout the country-that's not
unique. It's good for me to consult with
my Cabinet officers. And they are now
visiting the South Bronx and other similar
areas. I think when I am in Detroit later
on this month I'll also talk to families
who live in this kind of devastated area.
It's important for me to demonstrate
accurately my deep concern about this
urban deterioration. And it's also im-
portant, through the news media-the
radio and newspaper reports, the tele-
vision pictures to let the American peo-
ple know that such places exist in our
country.
I think the bill that I signed this week,
the Housing and Urban Development
Act of 1977,¹ will provide us with a base
or a framework on which we can make
substantial improvements in the urban
areas.
1 For the President's remarks on signing
H.R. 6655 into law, see page 1777 of this
volume.
The formulae that are being put for-
ward now-and the Congress is accept-
ing them-will orient more and more of
the rehabilitation money of all kinds to
the more blighted areas of our country,
both rural and urban.
So, it's an educational process for me,
an assurance to people who live in those
areas that we do indeed care, and also
an educational process for the people of
the country who don't know about these
instances.
BRIGADIER GENERAL TORRIJOS
OF PANAMA
Q. Mr. President, Panama's General
Torrijos will come to this country late
this week in an atmosphere in which a lot
of confusion has been generated over the
language of the treaty and how that will
be used.
How are you going to use his visit?
What is he going to do here? And will
you perhaps get into the language of the
treaty itself in terms of trying to clarify
what he thinks?
THE PRESIDENT. I think the language
of the treaty is adequate. I've had a
chance to meet with General Torrijos at
length on his other visit here and also
to meet on one occasion with both the
negotiators from Panama and our own
country when the negotiations were at a
crucial stage. Both General Torrijos and
I are faced with a difficult political prob-
lem-as he described it accurately, to
sell the same product in two different
markets.
We are determined that the canal will
be open, neutral, and free for use as
long as it is there beyond the end of this
century.
We do not have any inclination to in-
tervene in the internal affairs of Panama.
And when we say in this country, "We
reserve the right to take action to keep
the canal open," when they say in their
