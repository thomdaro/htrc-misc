National Urban League
Remarks at the League's National
Convention. July 25, 1977
Mr. McGannon and my good friend
Vernon Jordan, distinguished members
and guests of the Urban League:
The last annual convention I attended,
I went as a guest. And I heard, as the
main speaker of the final banquet eve-
ning, Eleanor Holmes Norton give a mov-
ing speech about the ties that bind fam-
ilies together and how the deprivations
of poverty and the lack of an ability of
primarily black males to be proud of
themselves justifiably was a disruptive
influence on the family structure. It was
a moving speech.
And now, Eleanor Holmes Norton is
in Washington, here with me, trying to
bring together the thrust of the Federal
Government to ensure equal opportunity
in employment. And she'll be part of your
program this year.
In Atlanta, as a joint friend of mine
and Vernon Jordan's at the time when
Vernon was thinking about running for
Congress, the man who finally ran for
that seat, Andy Young, has become
throughout the world the exemplification
of what this Nation stands for, what our
Government stands for in the field of
basic human rights. And Andy Young
will be on your program this year as a
member of our Cabinet, a man who has
a voice of his own, but who works closely
with me. And I might say other members
of the United Nations have joined with
him in letting the deprived people of the
world know that the United States, with
all its power and influence, is interested
in them and is their friend.
We've been concerned about the dete-
riorating quality of urban centers, and we
now have a Secretary of the Housing and
Urban Development Departmentâ€”a
woman who understands because of her
background and inclination, her experi-
ence and her heritage, the problem with
struggling people who feel excluded from
societal structures-Patricia Harris. And
she'll be on your program later on as part
of my own administration.
Griffin Bell will be here to explain the
new thrust of the Department of Justice.
