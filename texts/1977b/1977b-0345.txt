Memorandum for the Heads of Executive
Departments and Agencies
Subject: Advisory Committee Review
We have completed the reviews of Fed-
eral Advisory committees directed by my
memoranda of February 25 and May 24,
1977.
I am pleased that, as a result of the
actions recommended, the 1,189 advisory
committees reviewed will be reduced by
480 or forty percent of the total. I com-
mend you for your part in this effort to
make the government more effective and
efficient.
The actions necessary to carry out the
recommended terminations and consoli-
dations should be completed as soon as
possible. In addition, you should continue
to give your personal attention to assuring
that committees are terminated when no
longer necessary, and that new committees
are established only when absolutely
necessary.
