Administration of Jimmy Carter, 1977
July 15
Executive Office of the President
Message to the Congress Transmitting
Reorganization Plan No. 1 of 1977.
July 15, 1977
To the Congress of the United States:
I herewith transmit my plan for the
Reorganization of the Executive Office of
the President (EOP), Reorganization
Plan No. 1 of 1977. This plan is the first
of a series I intend to submit under the re-
organization authority vested in me by the
Reorganization Act of 1977 (P.L. 95-17).
It adheres to the purposes set forth in Sec-
tion 901 (a) of the Act.
This plan in conjunction with the other
steps I am taking will:
• eliminate seven of the seventeen
units now within the EOP and
modify the rest. There were 19 units
when I took office; the President's
Foreign Intelligence Advisory Board
and the Economic Policy Board have
already been abolished. Thus with
this plan I will have eliminated nine
of 19 EOP units.
• reduce EOP staffing by about 250
which includes the White House staff
reduction of 134 or 28% which
I have already ordered.
improve efficiency by centralizing
administrative functions; and
improve the process by which infor-
mation is provided for Presidential
decisionmaking.
These recommendations arise from a
careful, systematic study of the EOP.
They are based on the premise that the
EOP exists to serve the President and
should be structured to meet his needs.
They will reduce waste and cost while
improving the service the President, and
the nation, receive from the EOP.
The EOP now consists of the immedi-
ate White House Office, the Vice Presi-
dent's Office, the Office of Management
and Budget, and fourteen other agencies.
The EOP has a budget authority of about
$80,000,000 and 1,712 full time em-
ployees.
The White House Office concentrates
on close personal support including policy
and political advice and administrative
and operational services. The Office of
the Vice President provides similar sup-
port to him. OMB's primary mission is to
develop and implement the budget; it also
carries out a number of management and
reorganization activities.
Three EOP units have responsibility
for policy development:
• National Security Council
• Domestic Council
• Council on International Economic
Policy
The other 11 are more specialized
offices that offer analysis and advice, help
develop policy in certain areas, or carry
out special projects. These are:
• Council of Economic Advisers
• Council on Wage and Price Stability
• Office of the Special Representative
for Trade Negotiations
• Council on Environmental Quality
• Office of Science and Technology
Policy
• Office of Drug Abuse Policy
• Office of Telecommunications Policy
Intelligence Oversight Board
• Federal Property Council
Energy Resources Council
• Economic Opportunity Council
To make the EOP more effective, four
steps are necessary:
I. Strengthen management of policy
issues.
II. Limit the EOP, wherever possible,
to functions directly related to the
President's work.
III. Centralize administrative services.
IV. Reduce size of White House and
EOP staffs.
