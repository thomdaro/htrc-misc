SUMMARY AND OUTLINE OF FIRST-YEAR
DOMESTIC ACCOMPLISHMENTS
SUMMARY
The President's domestic policy
achievements during the first year of his
administration can be summarized as
follows:
I. The President tackled directly and
comprehensively major domestic prob-
lems that had been almost completely
ignored in previous years. If actions had
not been taken early in this administra-
tion, these problems would have
worsened, making any future efforts at
resolution far more difficult and costly.
Among the major problems confronted
were:
1. Energy. The country had no com-
prehensive energy plan. There was no
coherent way to reduce foreign imports
(costing the United States $45 billion
annually), shift to more abundant energy
sources, conserve energy use, or provide
fair incentives to encourage domestic en-
ergy production. The President proposed
a National Energy Plan designed to
achieve these goals by:
•
reducing the growth rate in energy
consumption to 2 percent per year;
reducing gasoline consumption by
10 percent;
cutting imports of foreign oil to less
than 6 million barrels a day, about
half the amount that would other-
wise be imported;
• establishing a strategic petroleum
reserve supply of at least 1 billion
barrels, which could meet all do-
mestic needs for 10 months;
increasing coal production by more
than two-thirds, to over 1 billion tons
a year;
insulating 90 percent of American
homes and all new buildings;
using solar energy in more than 22
million homes.
The National Energy Plan was the
President's most important domestic pri-
ority during the year. A House-Senate
conference committee is now considering
the plan, with final congressional passage
expected early next year.
2. Welfare Reform. For years, the coun-
try has suffered from a welfare system
that treats people with similar needs dif-
ferently,
ferently, provides incentives for family
breakup, discourages work, fails to assist
with employment efforts, and leads to
waste, fraud, and redtape.
The President proposed a comprehen-
sive overhaul of the Nation's welfare sys-
tem, the Program for Better Jobs and
Income, that will provide cash benefits to
32 million people out of 36 million eligi-
ble (current programs-30 million re-
ceive benefits out of 40 million eligible).
The major elements of the program in-
clude:
• creation of 1.4 million public serv-
ice jobs for low-income families,
which provide a job opportunity for
every poor family with children;
• tax reduction of $4.9 billion for the
working poor, through an increase
in the Earned Income Tax Credit;
improved recipient benefits-estab-
lishing a basic benefit of $4,200 for
single parent families (higher than
the AFDC benefit in 14 States);
• fiscal relief to the States and local
governments of $2.1 billion;
• work incentives to ensure that those
who work will have higher incomes
than those who do not;
