Administration of Jimmy Carter, 1977
Dec. 26
Q. Can you tell us, have you heard any-
thing from the Middle East, or have you
heard back from President Sadat or Mr.
Begin?
THE PRESIDENT. I've gotten some dis-
patches about it, but I don't know enough
about it to comment.
Q. When do you think you will talk to
them today?
THE PRESIDENT. I don't know. I get
a report from them a couple of times a
a day, but sometimes they want to make
announcements themselves, and I would
rather defer to them.
Q. Mr. President, what did Amy get
for Christmas?
THE PRESIDENT. Well, she got a room-
ful of stuff.
Q. Did she?
THE PRESIDENT. Yes.
Q. What was her big present?
THE PRESIDENT. I can't remember all
she got. She got books and electric trains.
Q. She enjoy running around a little in
her bare feet today, did she?
THE PRESIDENT. Yes, it's pretty warm.
If you all fall, it's not my fault. [Laugh-
ter]
Q. No, we won't sue.
Q. Have you been doing homework for
the foreign trip?
THE PRESIDENT. Yes, I've already
studied Poland and Iran and India. And
now I am working on Saudi Arabia and
France and Belgium. By the time mid-
night comes, I'll be through.
Q. The influenza epidemic, are you
looking to get the report from Atlanta
this week, from the Center for Disease
Control?
THE PRESIDENT. Yes, I know. No, I
haven't got any report yet. I'm sure I will
when I get back. I get those on a routine
basis.
Q. Will you be coming back to Plains
more often now? It seems a little quieter
to us. We don't seem quieter, but-
THE PRESIDENT. Well, all over the Na-
tion, November and December are the
slowest months. I think there will prob-
ably be a few more people in town after
Christmas.
Q. But it looks a little more normal,
doesn't it?
THE PRESIDENT. It's much better, yes.
It's more like it always was.
Well, I am sorry you all had to be down
here for Christmas and not at home.
Q. Well, we miss our families, but-
THE PRESIDENT. I know. Are you go-
ing to go to Europe with me?
Q. Yes.
THE PRESIDENT. Very good.
Q. Spend New Year's with the Shah of
Iran.
THE PRESIDENT. That's right. I will
meet with King Hussein there. I don't
know exactly where we'll meet yet. They
haven't worked out the details.
Q. And does it look likely that Presi-
dent Asad would be willing to see you
while you are over there?
THE PRESIDENT. I don't believe so. I
don't know anything about that.
Q. Well, have the rest of a merry
Christmas, and we'll see you tomorrow.
THE PRESIDENT. All right. 'Bye.
Q. Is that it for tonight? Can we go
off to our Christmas party now?
THE PRESIDENT. I don't know. I have
to check with my wife.
NOTE: The exchange began at approximately
5:30 p.m. at the home of Alton "Buddy"
Carter, the President's uncle.
