Administration of Jimmy Carter, 1977
Another subject that's of great impor-
tance to all our people is the quality of
the environment, and the first time I be-
came acquainted with President Oduber
was when he received an award as the
outstanding environmentalist among all
leaders in the world. He was here in
Washington, and I called to congratulate
him on that occasion.
The other thing I'd like to say-and
then perhaps he would like to make a
comment-is that 25 nations have come
here to be represented and to sign the
Declaration of Washington, which is a re-
markable demonstration of mutuality of
purpose and friendship that is perhaps
unprecedented. And we have used the
signing of the Panama treaty as an oppor-
tunity to bring these nations together. But
I think in Central America, we have a
much greater chance now to see the long-
standing disputes-for instance, that have
existed between El Salvador and Hon-
duras-be resolved.
And there's been a major commitment
to me and mutually among the leaders
for the enhancement of basic human
rights, which have long been a source of
deprivation in some of the countries of
our hemisphere.
So, Costa Rica represents the kind of
nation that's worthy of admiration and
emulation. And I'm very grateful that
President Oduber has been here to repre-
sent these great people.
