December 9, 1977
To Judge Frank Johnson
I have your letter of November 29 in
which you request that your nomination
to be Director of the Federal Bureau of
Investigation be withdrawn and it is with
sincere regret that I do so.
On behalf of the Nation, I am pleased
to express my appreciation for your
dedication, energy, and tireless efforts
throughout your career with the judicial
branch of the government. I want you to
know that the people of this country and
myself are truly happy that we will con-
tinue to have the benefit of your advice,
contributions, and services on the Bench.
You have my warmest wishes for a
speedy recovery and every happiness in
the years ahead.
Sincerely,
JIMMY CARTER
[The Honorable Frank M. Johnson, Jr., Chief
Judge, United States District Court, Middle
District of Alabama, Montgomery, Alabama

Dear Mr. President:
November 29, 1977
I write to request that you withdraw my
nomination to be the Director of the Fed-
eral Bureau of Investigation.
As
you are aware, since I agreed in the
middle of August, 1977, to accept the Di-
rectorship of the Bureau, it was necessary
that I undergo major surgery to correct
an abdominal aortic aneurysm. While the
surgery appears to be completely success-
ful and I am recovering, my rate of recov-
ery is very slow. It is evident to me that it
will be several more months before I will
regain my strength and stamina. It will
not be fair to the Federal Bureau of Inves-
tigation or to me to keep this matter pend-
ing any longer.
I want you to know that I appreciate
the confidence that you have expressed
through my nomination and I regret that
conditions over which I have no control
necessitate this letter requesting with-
drawal of the nomination.
Respectfully yours,
FRANK M. JOHNSON, JR.
