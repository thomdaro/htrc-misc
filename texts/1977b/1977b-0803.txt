National Energy Plan
Statement on a Resolution Adopted by the
National Conference of Black Mayors.
October 29, 1977
The President was informed that the
National Conference of Black Mayors,
meeting in Washington, D.C., adopted a
resolution supporting the proposed Na-
tional Energy Plan. He issued the follow-
ing statement from Camp David:
â€œThis is an important statement of sup-
port from an organization of leaders rep-
resenting a sizable constituency in
America. I appreciate this action by the
National Conference of Black Mayors.
"The mayors have shown that they rec-
ognize that a failure to face up to our
energy problem will most adversely affect
poor people and black people. It shows
recognition that passage of the energy pro-
gram is not a contest between the branches
of Government--that, instead, it is a test
of our national will. It is my hope that this
action by the mayors will add momentum
to passage of the National Energy Plan."
NOTE: The statement was made available
by the White House Press Office. It was not is-
sued in the form of a White House press release.
