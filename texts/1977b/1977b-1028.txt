THE PRESIDENT. It was a good meet-
THE PRESIDENT. I might do a little ing. I sympathize with them and under-

Q. On your trip coming up?
Q. What about the budget and taxes?
THE PRESIDENT. Well, I've got all the
notebooks on the different countries we
are going to go to after Christmas. Then
I am going to put the final touches on
the Executive order on the intelligence
community. I'll do that while I am here.
Q. Have you pretty much finished with
the budget, your final decisions now?
THE PRESIDENT. Yes. I signed off on all
the decisions yesterday morning. I'll have

$95 or $100. 5-10-15 is a-[inaudible]â€”
that's a standard around here. The same
way with nitrogen; it's gone up prob-

Q. We are having a little difficulty hear-
ing you, Mr. President; I'm sorry.
THE PRESIDENT. Ann [Ann Compton,
ABC News], I didn't want to have a press
conference.
I sympathized with them. They are
good folks and they are trying to do things
peacefully and let the consumers of the
country know that farmers have a prob-
lem.
Q. Did they outline their five points to
you, sir?
THE PRESIDENT. Yes, I was familiar
with them already.
Q. Your stand earlier on the farm bill
and the fact that it was recently signed
and the effect won't be felt for some
time-did you express that point of view
with them?
THE PRESIDENT. Yes. I had talked to
some of the leaders here on the phone
