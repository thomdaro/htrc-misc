Visit of President Perez
of Venezuela
Remarks on the Departure of President Perez.
June 29, 1977
This has been one of the most pleasant
and productive meetings that we've ever
had. The expressions of friendship be-
tween our countries are genuine, and we
share deep commitments to common goals
and common purposes.
A constant reminder in the center of
our Capital City of the vision and hope of
our two peoples is expressed by the Otero
sculpture, and I'm very grateful for it.
This is a photograph, and I think that we
will have in the future a chance to enjoy
this for many generations to come.
The discussions were compatible and
harmonious, and the friendship that exists
between our countries is absolutely un-
shakeable.
Thank you very much.
NOTE: The President spoke at 11:10 a.m. on
the South Lawn at the White House following
his final meeting with President Perez.
