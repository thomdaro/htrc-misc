Administration of Jimmy Carter, 1977
do to each other the same treatment. Cer-
tainly, we will find points of coincidence
very important within the global politics
that are discussed today in the great
forums of the world. Likewise, we are go-
ing to deal with matters that are essential
for us, the relations between the United
States and the Latin American com-
munity.
I already had the honor and the very
pleasant opportunity to hear from the
lips of your wife, in Caracas, many aspects
of the talks that we are going to hold. Mrs.
Carter brought the testimony of the
friendship and admiration of the Vene-
zuelan people and of all of the peoples of
Latin America for the people of the
United States and for the Government
of President Carter.
For our hemispheric countries, the best
perspectives are open. I sincerely believe
that this is an historical moment without
comparison, when the United States is
going to assume a leadership roleâ€”which
we do appreciate-not that of economic
or military importance, but that of the
great values of mankind.
Mr. President, Mrs. Carter, my
wife
and I in this first moment of our meeting
give to you our thanks, and we express
to you that beyond the formalities of
pro-
tocol there exists a sincere friendship that
will join in brotherhood the peoples of
Latin America with the peoples of the
United States.
NOTE: The President spoke at 10:39 a.m. on
the South Lawn of the White House. President
Perez spoke in Spanish, and his remarks were
translated by an interpreter.
