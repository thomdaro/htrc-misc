Meeting With President
Daniel Oduber Quir√≥s
of Costa Rica
Remarks to Reporters Following the Meet-
ing. September 9, 1977
REPORTER. Would you be so kind as to
inform us about your discussions?
THE PRESIDENT. Well, it's very difficult
to find any differences that exist between
Costa Rica and the United States. If
there is a pure democracy in the world
which has been an example for all nations
in preserving human freedoms, it would
be Costa Rica.
This is a nation which has protected
itself, not through military might, since
you don't even have an army, but which
has preserved its own freedom by mak-
ing those freedoms so attractive.
We have followed in the footsteps of
President Oduber and his predecessors in
own insistence on publicizing the
deprivation of human rights in this
hemisphere.
Our trade arrangements with Costa
Rica are mutually advantageous. The
friendship that has long existed between
our countries is a very precious posses-
sion for us. I've been to Costa Rica to
visit. My wife has been there twice; Am-
bassador Young has been there recently;
Mr. Todman has been there recently.
And we are very proud that President
Oduber could come here for this meeting.
