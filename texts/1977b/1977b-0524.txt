Columbus Day, 1977
Remarks on Signing Proclamation 4527.
September 28, 1977
This is a happy day for us. I notice the
expressions on everyone's face are pleas-
ant.
I think it's important for us, at least
once a year, to recognize the significance
with which Americans look upon Colum-
bus Day. There are only two official holi-
days of our Nation that recognize people,
men. One is Washington's Birthday, the
founder of our country, and the other one
is Columbus, who discovered our conti-
nent.
This is a significant occasion because it
represents two basic purposes of our coun-
try. One is the spirit of discovery. Re-
cently, we've been proud of the fact that
Americans were first to the Moon, and
we've admired the courage of those men
who went into space. But I think an equal
degree of courage was aboard the Niña
and the Pinta and the Santa María, who
embarked on an unknown path with very
little support, no contact with a home
base, and with very little acknowledg-
ment at the time of their tremendous ac-
complishment.
And of course, the reason that they
came to our country was for opportu-
nity. Not only material wealth and a bet-
ter life for people resulted from this trip
but also it was the first step in a new de-
gree of human freedom.
We have only 15 more years to go be-
fore we celebrate the 500th anniversary of
Columbus' discovery. And I hope I'm
around to join with you in the celebration,
which I would guess would be one of the
most sustained and enjoyable occurrences
that ever took place in our country. I
think it's not too early for us to start plan-
ning that occasion. [Laughter]
Five hundred years is a long time, but
I think when you go back into the history
of Italians, more than 2,000 years, and if
you would inventory all the great
achievements of humankind, those of the
ancestors of Italian Americans would
stand out very clearly in science, art, mu-
sic, medicine, and the concepts of govern-
