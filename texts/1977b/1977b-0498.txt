Sept. 23
Administration of Jimmy Carter, 1977
The United States is a young Nation,
but our debt to that courageous Norseper-
son, Leif Erikson, predates 1776 and re-
calls a distant age when brave adventurers
sailed forth into the unknown. As a people
we continue to embody this spirit of bold
discovery, and we take pride in his his-
torical exploits.
As a mark of respect for Leif Erikson
and the Norse explorers, the Congress of
the United States, by joint resolution ap-
proved September 2, 1964 (78 Stat. 849,
36 U.S.C. 169c), authorized the President
to proclaim October 9 in each year as
Leif Erikson Day.
Now, THEREFORE, I, JIMMY CARTER,
President of the United States of America,
do hereby designate Sunday, October 9,
1977, as Leif Erikson Day and I direct
the appropriate Government officials to
display the flag of the United States on
all Government buildings that day.
I also invite the people of the United
States to honor the memory of Leif Erik-
son on that day by holding appropriate
exercises and ceremonies in suitable places
throughout our land.
IN WITNESS WHEREOF, I have here-
unto set my hand this twenty-third day of
September, in the year of our Lord nine-
teen hundred seventy-seven, and of the
Independence of the United States of
America the two hundred and second.
JIMMY CARTER
