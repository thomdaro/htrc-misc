Administration of Jimmy Carter, 1977
Dec. 28
great energy, not only exceptional knowl-
edge of the business world; he also brings
to it the knowledge of the Federal Re-
serve System. And what is most impor-
tant of all, he brings to his tasks moral in-
tegrity, a fine character, and these are the
most important attributes for that high
position.
I think, Mr. President, you are to be
congratulated on your choice, and I am
confident that Mr. Miller will serve this
country and will serve it well. You have
my very best wishes and my respect.
MR. MILLER. Thank you very much,
Dr. Burns.
THE PRESIDENT. We would have time
for two or three questions if anyone has
any.
REPORTER. Will Dr. Burns stay on the
Federal Reserve as a member?
THE PRESIDENT. I would be very
pleased if he would, but that's a decision
that he would have to make.
Dr. Burns, I don't know if you want
to respond or not.
CHAIRMAN BURNS. The good Doctor
is in the habit of thinking now and then.
He'll think this one over carefully.
[Laughter]
Q. May I ask Mr. Miller a question?
THE PRESIDENT. Certainly.
Q. Mr. Miller, you've kind of a bal-
ance between unemployment and infla-
tion-how to fine-tune it, if you can. Is
it your view that perhaps we need to
work more on unemployment than we
have been, that perhaps the Fed needs
to sort of tilt a little bit more?
MR. MILLER. I think we need to work
on both at once. It's very interesting that
in the Public Agenda Foundation re-
search done in 1976, there was a wide-
spread opinion that one or the other had
to be given priority, but the public at
large felt that both could be worked on
simultaneously, and I happen to share
that view. And I think that working in
harmony with the fiscal policies of the
President, the monetary policies of the
Federal Reserve, I think we can tackle
both at once and achieve what we really
need-full employment with price sta-
bility.
Q. If I may follow that up, can you
tighten every discount rate? For in-
stance, you are acting on the money
supply, and it has an impact which isn't
balanced, isn't six of one and half a dozen
of the other.
MR. MILLER. I think we will move
from here in the context of the economy
as it develops over the next year, and
I'm sure that we can find ways in which
we can tackle both issues simultaneously,
and we certainly shall try.
Q. [Inaudible]
MR. MILLER. Well, I think we'll have
to let Dr. Burns, who's Chairman now,
decide that. And when I'm Chairman,
perhaps, I'll have a say.
Q. Sir, how will your policies differ
from Dr. Burns'?
MR. MILLER. My policies will be one
of seven Board of Governors, and I hope
that I will play a leadership role in con-
tinuing the policies that Dr. Burns has
stood for so well and so long, and that
as the economy goes through its natural
evolution and develops in its natural
ways, that we can continue to be crea-
tive and innovative and responsive to
the needs in the way in which they exist
during the coming years.
I think the past is prologue. We must
learn from the past and we must extrap-
olate from that and always seek to im-
prove and to be creative.
Q. Mr. Miller, now one more ques-
tion. Do you feel that the American
Government should do more to bolster
the dollar on the foreign market?
