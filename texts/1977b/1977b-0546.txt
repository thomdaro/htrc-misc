Memorandum for the Heads of Executive
Departments and Agencies
As you know, I have repeatedly empha-
sized as a major goal of U.S. foreign pol-
icy the importance of meeting basic hu-
man needs-in particular, the alleviation
of world hunger and malnutrition. In or-
der to develop a major initiative in this
area, I have formed a World Hunger
Working Group headed by my Special
Assistant, Peter Bourne, to coordinate a
White House study of world hunger with
other U.S. domestic and international
food and agricultural policies. Peter
Bourne, representing the Working Group,
will participate on the soon to be formed
Cabinet Level Committee on Food and
Agricultural Policy, chaired by the Secre-
tary of Agriculture.
The Working Group consists of Exec-
utive Office Organizations-National Se-
curity Council (NSC), Domestic Council
basis for a Presidential statement outlin-
ing the following goals:
-to provide more equitable access to
available food and to improve nutri-
tional well-being;
-to increase the supply of food relative
to need;
-to offer food assistance to those unable
to purchase enough food for adequate
nutrition;
-to assure a decision-making process,
management, and resources adequate
to implement these policies.
Departments and agencies affected by
this memorandum should submit to the
chairman of the Working Group their rec-
ommendations by close of business on Oc-
tober 21st.
The Working Group will review the
recommendations and develop a set of
U.S. government policy options designed
to make a significant impact on world
hunger. Departments and agencies will
have an opportunity to comment on the
Working Group's list of options before it
is submitted to me.
