National Day of Prayer, 1977
Proclamation 4532. October 13, 1977
By the President of the United States
of America
A Proclamation
Throughout our Nation's history Amer-
icans of all faiths have turned to Divine
Providence for the strength and wisdom
to meet whatever challenges were put be-
fore them with honor and dignity.
The tasks we face today are as great as
those faced by any generation of Ameri-
cans. Our actions and choices will, for
many years to come, affect not only our-
selves but all the peoples with whom we
share this tiny planet.
It is therefore fitting that we set aside
a day of prayer and meditation to ask the
Almighty for the vision to see our duty
as individuals and as a Nation and for the
courage to pursue it, even at the cost of
personal or collective sacrifice.
Recognizing this, the Congress by joint
resolution approved April 17, 1952 (36
U.S.C. 185; 66 Stat. 64) has called upon
the President to set aside a suitable day
each year as a National Day of Prayer.
Now, THEREFORE, I, JIMMY CARTER,
President of the United States of America,
do hereby proclaim Thursday, December
15, 1977, as National Day of Prayer. I ask
all Americans to join with me on that
day in asking God's help that we may see
and understand our responsibilities and
discharge them in a manner that befits
a just and good people.
IN WITNESS WHEREOF, I have here-
unto set my hand this thirteenth day of
October, in the year of our Lord nineteen
hundred seventy-seven, and of the Inde-
1792
