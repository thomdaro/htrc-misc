Transatlantic Air Fares
are a $256 budget fare, roundtrip between
New York and London, and a $290 ad-
vanced
vanced purchase excursion ("super-
APEX") fare, roundtrip between London
and New York. Similar super-APEX
fares will be offered from Boston, Phila-
delphia,
delphia, Chicago, Detroit, Los Angeles,
Washington, and Miami.
The CAB has recently allowed a $256
standby fare and a $280 budget fare, but
on September 16 it ruled against the $256
budget fare and the $290 super-APEX
fare.
In his letter to the Board, the President
stated that â€œI have decided to reject the
Board's order as inconsistent with this Ad-
ministration's foreign economic policy. I
must emphasize that my international
aviation policy carries with it a commit-
ment to low fare, competitive interna-
tional air service for the benefit of Amer-
ican consumers.'
In its decision, the Civil Aeronautics
Board expressed concern that low fare
service by scheduled airlines might ad-
versely affect the charter industry.
To make sure that consumers have the
widest variety of low fares available to
them, the President urged the Board to
move as rapidly as possible to remove Fed-
eral regulations that impede low cost
charter service. The Departments of State
and Transportation will also be undertak-
ing discussions with European government
aviation authorities to remove restrictions
on both charters and other low fare
services.
The fares approved today are experi-
mental and will be available to the public
Announcement of Approval of New Low-Cost through March 31, 1978. Transportation
Fares. September 26, 1977
President Carter today overruled the
Civil Aeronautics Board and approved
new low-cost transatlantic air service. The
specific fares approved by the President
Secretary Adams will study these winter
fares to determine how responsive they are
to the public need and how these fares
and charter services might be made more
widely available as the basis for long-term,
low-cost transatlantic service.
