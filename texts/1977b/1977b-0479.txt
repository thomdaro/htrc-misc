Administration of Jimmy Carter, 1977
Sept. 20
these practices will now be made illegal
among about 5,000 collection agencies,
most of which are honest and law-abiding
and do a proper job; some of which,
though, need to be corrected. About $5
billion a year are collected by these agen-
cies. And this is a great step forward in
indicating to the American people that
the Congress believes that consumers
need to be treated fairly.
So, because of these reasons and many
others, I congratulate the Members of the
House and Senate behind me, who rep-
resent many others, and express my con-
gratulations to the consumers of America
and my own pride in being able to sign
this legislation, which is a great step
forward.
NOTE: The President spoke at 10 a.m. at the
signing ceremony in the Rose Garden at the
White House.
As enacted, H.R. 5294 is Public Law 95-109,
approved September 20.
