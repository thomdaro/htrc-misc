ried forward the process of normalizing

he showed how much could be achieved
by "the application of intelligence and
tact."
Laurence N. Woodworth
Statement on the Death of the Assistant
Secretary of the Treasury. December 7, 1977
The death of Laurence Woodworth is
a personal loss to me and a loss to our
Nation of one of its most dedicated pub-
lic servants.
For more than three decades, he served
with the Joint Committee on Taxation
of the Congress, where his understanding
of our tax system was matched only by
his determination to improve that sys-
tem and by his patience in dealing with
those who knew far less than he. For the
last 11 months, as Assistant Secretary of
the Treasury for Tax Policy, he directed
this administration's efforts to develop a
better, fairer tax system.
Larry Woodworth was the first Assist-
ant Secretary I appointed, and in the last
year I worked with him personally more
than with any other Assistant Secretary
in the Government. In that time I de-
veloped a profound respect for his abil-
ities and an admiration for his modest,
self-effacing manner.
I extend my deepest sympathy to his
wife, Margaret, and their children.

Chanukah Torch Relay, 1977
Remarks on Receiving the Maccabean Torch
at a Ceremony in the Oval Office.
December 7, 1977
I want to thank you very much for let-
ting me participate in this ceremony.
As all of you know, 2,000 years agoâ€”
or 2,100 years ago, the Maccabees fought
for and achieved a tremendous victory
for freedom. This was the first occurrence
in the history of humankind when the
basic struggle was for religious freedom.
And that was a precursor of the constant
struggle for the Jewish people to have
their own land, free of outside domina-
tion, a chance to live in peace, to worship
God as they choose.
And I believe that it's a very wonder-
ful thing for the world that the Masada,
