Informal Exchange With Reporters Prior to
Visiting Allie Smith. December 25, 1977
REPORTER. Merry Christmas.
THE PRESIDENT. Same to you. It's a
shame to get you up so early so far away
from home.
REPORTER. Well, on Christmas, you get
up early anyway when you have family.
THE PRESIDENT. Yes, I know. We al-
ways get up about 5:00.
Q. Tell us how Christmas has gone so
far.
THE PRESIDENT. Well, it's fine. I just
placed a phone call to President Sadat
and Prime Minister Begin. And they're in
Ismailia, and I was at the Pond House.
So, the connection was pretty bad. I could
just barely hear them. So, I relayed a
message through to them that they have
my best wishes and support and that the
whole world awaits the peace that they
can bring us on this Christmas Day. They
are together in Ismailia, and we hope that
they will be successful.
We've had a good Christmas ourselves
so far. We will be visiting Rosalynn's
mother now, already been out to my
mother's house, already had Santa Claus
at our house. And then we will go to Sun-
day school and church.
Q. Are you going to talk to them again
after they've talked together?
THE PRESIDENT. After they finish this
day's work, yes.
Q. Will we get a report from you, per-
haps, later?
THE PRESIDENT. Perhaps.
Q. Mr. President, what did you get for
Christmas?
THE PRESIDENT. Well, I got some
binoculars, and I got a coat that Mother
gave me that came from Ireland, a hand-
woven tweed coat. And I got several
books, and I got two shirts from Chip and
Jeffrey. I got a pretty good haul so far-
got several albums-got Mahler's Eighth
Symphony.
Q. Can you say how Mr. Sadat and Mr.
Begin's talks are have they been con-
ferring some already?
THE PRESIDENT. They just are getting
started, and we didn't go into
into any
any detail
about it. We've had very close and
thorough discussions with Prime Minister
Begin in Jerusalem, with our Ambassador
there, and also with our Ambassador and
President Sadat in Cairo precedent to
this meeting. But we haven't had a
chance to meet or talk to them since
they've been conversing.
Q. Do you think that in that you are
going to meet with Jordan's King Hus-
sein, it might also be possible to meet
with President Asad on your trip?
THE PRESIDENT. I don't know. It
would suit me fine if it could be worked
out. I think the only time that I would
have available to talk to him was if we
could perhaps meet in Riyadh, but I
don't know if it's possible.
Q. Is there any possibility you might
go to Cairo?
THE PRESIDENT. I don't think so. If I
did, it wouldâ€”it's not something we've
thought about or plan now.
Q. Have you suggested to the Syrians
or President Asad the possibility of such
a meeting?
THE PRESIDENT. No, I haven't. When
Secretary Vance was over there, he talked
to the different leaders about the possi-
bility of my meeting with some of them
