The needs of the voluntary organiza-
tions supported by the Combined Federal
Campaign are great. These organizations
perform essential services in helping the
disadvantaged, in serving youth and the
aged, in healing the sick, and in helping August 11
those in need overseas. CFC gives all of
us who are Federal employees, whether
civilian or military, a unique opportunity
to pledge our help to people in our com-
munity, our nation, and around the
worldâ€”a pledge made more convenient
by the availability of voluntary payroll
deductions.

ganization and that you appoint one of
your top assistants as your Vice Chair-
man. Please advise Secretary Blumenthal

support in this endeavor, and I urge you
