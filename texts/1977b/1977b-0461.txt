Administration of Jimmy Carter, 1977
source. Older people, those with family
responsibilities, the handicapped, students
and others who are unable to work full
time can be valuable additions to an
agency's permanent work force. To assure
that we in the Federal Government take
advantage of the many talents available,
I am asking you to establish innovative
programs to expand opportunities for
men and women seeking part-time em-
ployment.
Such programs should include redesign
of jobs and work schedules to open up
permanent part-time opportunities, re-
cruitment efforts to attract capable men
and women to part-time work, review of
rules, regulations, and procedures to elim-
inate artificial barriers to part-time em-
ployment, and pilot and research studies
to determine where part-time employees
can make the maximum contribution.
I believe that much can be done within
existing employment ceilings. The Civil
Service Commission will coordinate these
efforts and will report to me periodically
on the progress achieved and the need
for any further actions.
