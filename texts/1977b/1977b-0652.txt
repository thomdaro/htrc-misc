Administration of Jimmy Carter, 1977
Death of Bing Crosby
Statement by the President. October 14, 1977
For all the roads he traveled in his
memorable career, Bing Crosby remained
a gentleman, proof that a great talent can
be a good man despite the pressures of
show business. He lived a life his fans
around the world felt was typically Amer-
ican: successful yet modest, casual but
elegant. He revolutionized popular music,
sang the biggest hit of all time, yet was a
man who would be at ease in any Ameri-
can home.
