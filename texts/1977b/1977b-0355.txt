Administration of Jimmy Carter, 1977
Aug. 26
to change any laws, regulations and poli-
cies which discriminate on the basis of sex.
I am directing the Attorney General, as
chief law officer of the Federal govern-
ment, to coordinate all of the activities
undertaken by the departments and agen-
cies to eliminate sex discrimination. He
has sent a letter to each agency today giv-
ing details of the proposed procedures.
Where statutory revision or repeal is
necessary, I will recommend to the Con-
gress that appropriate legislation be en-
acted. Where executive action will suf-
fice, I will take appropriate steps to en-
sure that benefits and opportunities pro-
vided by the Federal government are
made equally available to all, regardless
of sex.
In taking this action, we intend to re-
tain and possibly expand any existing
protections and benefits provided for
homemakers and families. We believe
that offering opportunity to all should not
threaten or diminish the protection pro-
vided those performing special functions
in our society.
Federal law should be a model of non-
discrimination for every state and for the
rest of the world. The Federal govern-
ment, which is actively involved in
eliminating sex discrimination in many
areas, should not uphold it in others.
It is my hope that the project initiated
today will result in such a model and the
goal of equal rights and opportunity for
all our citizens under the law will be
realized.
