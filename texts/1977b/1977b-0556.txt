Sept. 30
Administration of Jimmy Carter, 1977
love and loneliness, honor and humor. It
vibrates with the passions and scenes that
make up our common heritage. Country
music is as universal as a sunset and as
personal as a baby's smile. It is fitting that
we acknowledge the importance of a form
that reflects so much the lives and hopes
of the people who make up our nation
and pay tribute to the talented people
who have contributed to its growing pop-
ularity.
Now, THEREFORE, I, JIMMY CARTER,
President of the United States of Amer-
ica, ask the people of this Nation to mark
the month of October 1977, with suitable
observances as Country Music Month.
IN WITNESS WHEREOF, I have here-
unto set my hand this thirtieth day of
September, in the year of our Lord nine-
teen hundred seventy-seven, and of the
Independence of the United States of
America the two hundred and second.
