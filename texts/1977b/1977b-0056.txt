June 30
Administration of Jimmy Carter, 1977
I was asked by a group of local news-
paper editors if there were any surprises
to me. And I said that the degree of dis-
turbance by the Soviets about what I con-
sidered to be a routine and normal com-
mitment to human rights was a surprise.
It has not caused me any deep concern,
and I would certainly not do it otherwise
in retrospect.
Q. Could I just follow up? Did any of
them suggest that you not undertake this
campaign?
THE PRESIDENT. No, never.
