THE PRESIDENT. Did you say "ethical
standards?"
Q. The question was asked about this
two press conferences ago. Is it now and
has it been the position of the Carter ad-
ministration in the past or present that
illegal, unethical, and/or improper con-
duct as well as actual, potential conflicts
of interest and the appearance of im-
propriety would not be tolerated?
THE PRESIDENT. That's correct.
Q. That being the case, in light of the
fact that the California Fair Political
Practices Committee decided to charge a
campaign committee of Robert H. Men-
delsohn, the Assistant Secretary of the In-
terior for Policy, Budget, and Administra-
tion-designate, with illegal conduct,
which you said you would not tolerate, in
connection with accepting a total of
$16,500 in watered campaign contribu-
tions by the way, the reports were signed
by Mr. Mendelsohn and sort of a pro
forma campaign treasurer who said that
he really didn't know anything about the
details and Mr. Mendelsohn knew all
about the finances, or indicated thatâ€”
why are you continuing to support the
Mendelsohn nomination, especially in the
wake of the trauma we have just been
through on Watergate?
THE PRESIDENT. I have to say I am
not familiar with that case. And I don't
know if what you've described are just
allegations or whether improprieties have
been proven.
Q. It is the report of the committee-
THE PRESIDENT. But I'm sure that if
any of those allegations are proven, that
neither I nor the Secretary of Interior nor
the congressional committee who will
confirm his nomination will approve of it.

much.
