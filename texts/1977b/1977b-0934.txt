Administration of Jimmy Carter, 1977
him on the phone when I was in trouble.
I've gotten his quiet and private and
sound advice. And I've come to recognize

loves a man like Hubert Humphrey and is
loved so deeply by him.
Thank
you very much.
NOTE: The President spoke at 9:40 p.m. in
the International Ballroom at the Washington
