Executive Branch
Memorandum for the Heads of Departments
and Agencies. July 26, 1977
Memorandum for the Heads of Depart-
ments and Agencies
Subject: Affirmative Action
Last March I wrote to each of you
concerning my commitment to affirma-
tive action in the Executive Branch. I in-
dicated that at some future time I would
expect progress reports on affirmative ac-
tion from the executive departments and
agencies.
I have directed the Presidential Per-
sonnel Office at the White House to as-
sume responsibility for monitoring prog-
ress on affirmative action hiring for non-
career positions throughout the Executive
Branch.
The Presidential Personnel Office will
be briefing each department or agency on
established. If you have other ideas as to
the reporting procedures which have been
how affirmative action might be strength-
ened, please send them to me through the
Presidential Personnel Office.
