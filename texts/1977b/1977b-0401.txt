Administration of Jimmy Carter, 1977
Sept. 8
President Banzer, I think, will take a per-
sonal interest, within the framework of
Bolivian law, that attention will be given
to their case.
We have good relations with Bolivia.
And we appreciate the cooperation that
has been evidenced between the Bolivian
people and our people.
We expect good progress to be made in
return of the political processes to civilian
rule, hopefully by 1980 or before. Presi-
dent Banzer reemphasized his commit-
ment to this process.
Q. Mr. President, what is the outlook
for the sca corridor, as you see it-
THE PRESIDENT. No, I think there is a
hope that President Banzer can meet with
the Presidents of Peru and Chile, and
what the prospects might be for success, I
really don't know. But we have wished
him well.
REPORTER. Thank you very much.
THE PRESIDENT. Thank you.
NOTE: The President spoke at 2 p.m. on the
South Grounds of the White House.
The transcript of the remarks was made
available by the White House Press Office. It

press release.
Meeting With President Joaqu√≠n
Balaguer of the Dominican
Republic
Remarks to Reporters Following the Meeting.
September 8, 1977
REPORTER. Mr. President?
THE PRESIDENT. Yes, ma'am?
Q. Tell us all about it.
THE PRESIDENT. Well, we have an ex-
tremely good relationship with the
Dominican Republic, as you know. Presi-
dent Balaguer has set an example for all
leaders in this nation in changing his own
country and his own people away from a
former totalitarian government to one of
increasingly pure democracy. And the
commitment that he's shown in preserv-
ing human rights and leading the other
nations in this effort have been an in-
spiration to me.
I doubt that any other two countries
have worked more closely together in
matters relating to our own hemisphere,
in the United Nations than has the
Dominican Republic and the United
States of America. We cooperate on the
sugar agreement. We cooperate in our
debates in the General Assembly of the
U.N. We cooperate in matters that re-
late to the Organization of American
States.
We've been
been talking
talking to President
Balaguer about the upcoming elections
next year, which will be open and free
and, I think, which will be a model to
everyone on the universality of the right
to vote and the free expression of the
people's will in choosing their own gov-
ernment.
So, in the last 7 years, there's been un-
believable progress made in the Domini-
can Republic. President Balaguer pointed
out to me that there's a great need for us
to realize that their major crop, their
major export item is sugar, and what we
do here in our own country has a pro-
found impact on the well-being of his own
people.
And of course, we hope that we'll have
an international sugar agreement during
1977. We produce tremendous quantities
of sugar in our own Nation from sugar
beets and cane. And of course, we also
import large quantities of sugar.
So, these discussions, particularly with
him and with the other nations, are very
important to me.
Q. When do you think the Senate is
going to bring up these treaties, and are
you confident of the result?
