Strategy Council
Remarks to Members of the Council.
November 7, 1977
I'd like to say a few things to start
with before I ask you to report on what
you have decided.
This Strategy Council, as you know,
is responsible under the law for evolving
broad policy matters for the drug control
program.
Dr. Bourne, who is working in the
White House, will coordinate what you
decide and work very closely with the
agencies involved as well. We've had re-
markable success, I think, already in this
first 10 months.
The purity of heroin is at the lowest
point that it's been in 7 years. We've had,
as well as that, an increase of 25 percent
in heroin prices on the street, which is
another good indication of the scarcity
of it. In the first 6 months of this year,
we've had about a 7-percent reduction in
the National Crime Index, which I think
is quite often directly related to heroin
use, at least in some types of crimes.
We've also had good, perhaps even
unprecedented, communication and co-
operation among the agencies involvedâ€”
between Justice and Treasury, for in-
stance, and between HEW and State,
Agriculture, the United Nations as we
try to not only control the sources of
heroin but provide alternative crops to be
produced and approach the United Na-
tions and other countries, other than our-
selves, to join with us in holding down
drug traffic.
We've got an opportunity, I think, as
we go into the new domestic programs, to
provide adequate treatment for those who
are addicted to drugs, including alcohol.
And I'm particularly interested in pur-
suing-working with HEW and others-
the control of the so-called legal drugs,
barbiturates, that have probably caused
almost as many deaths as most of the
other drugs. And this overprescription of
barbiturates by medical doctors is almost
a matter of habit in some communities
of our country, and we need to make sure
that they aren't used in a destructive way
