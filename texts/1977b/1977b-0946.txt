Dec. 9
Administration of Jimmy Carter, 1977
These departments and agencies per-
form services which directly or indirectly
benefit the lives of every American, par-
ticularly the least fortunate among us.
Public health, the education of the young,
jobs and income security all depend heav-
ily upon the programs supported by this
legislation.
H.J. Res. 662 reflects some of the efforts
which this administration undertook last
February in its FY 1978 budget revisions,
for it incorporates provisions which:
-expand the Job Corps by 14,000 posi-
tions;
-increase by 400,000 the number of
college students receiving Basic Edu-
cational Opportunity Grants and
raise the maximum award to $1,600
a year;
-provide funds to begin to ensure that
every child in America is immunized
against dangerous communicable dis-
eases;
-provide additional funds to help res-
idents of rural and inner-city areas
get high-quality medical care through
the National Health Service Corps.
In signing this resolution, I do want to
express my concern about Section 208 of
H.R. 7555, which the resolution incor-
porates. Section 208 places limits, with
respect to student transportation, on the
enforcement of Title VI of the Civil
Rights Act of 1964. I have been advised
by the Department of Justice that this
section, in its application, may raise new
and vexing constitutional questions, add-
ing further complexities to an already
complex area of law. Moreover, this sec-
tion may cause additional expense and
delay in resolving issues important to par-
ents, students, and school administrators
in numerous school systems throughout
the country.
NOTE: As enacted, H.J. Res. 662 is Public
Law 95-205, approved December 9.
