Administration of Jimmy Carter, 1977
Sept. 2
American working man and woman.
The sweat and skill of American work-
ers built this country and preserved it
through wars and crises. Today, workers
and their organizations are giving strong
support to the national effort to restore
our economy's health. This is in the fin-
est tradition of organized labor, which
has served not just its own members but
all people through its century-long strug-
gle for social and economic justice.
On this Labor Day, let us affirm our
determination to build a future together
in which all of us can enjoy the blessings
of a more equitable and humane society.
