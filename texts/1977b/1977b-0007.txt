Foreword
The papers in this volume bring to a conclusion the official documentary
record of my administration during 1977.
By the complexity of their subject matter they serve as a reminder of the
difficult responsibilities that Americans are called upon to face in the last quarter
of the Twentieth Century. Each generation must do its best with circumstances
not of its own choosing, aware that in the eyes of history its character will be meas-
ured and its spirit tested by the response it gives to them.
The issues dealt with in these documents are the hardest and most intractable
problems of our time. We have approached them in the knowledge that they
must be resolved--but also in the knowledge that no government can hope to
resolve them alone, without the patience and good will and active aid of the
people we serve.
I am pleased by our accomplishments in this first year, but I also know the
path ahead is not easy and much more remains to be done. Our challenge is to act
while the times are opportune. As the Bible says, "Let us not be weary in well-
doing; for in due season we shall reap, if we faint not."
