July 25
Administration of Jimmy Carter, 1977
be
very
constructive. And together we can
put smiles on the faces instead of tears,
and we can have a support of our system
of government instead of a lashing out be-
cause deprived and unemployed people
feel alienated from the structure of so-
ciety that's been so good to all of us here.
Those are my hopes and my dreams
and my prayers.
You're partners with me and Vernon
and all of you. I'm proud of that partner-
ship and what it can mean to us in this
greatest of all nations on Earth.
Thank you very much.
NOTE: The President spoke at 9:05 a.m. in the

privately with Donald H. McGannon, president
of the board of trustees, and Vernon E. Jordan,
Jr., executive director, of the National Urban
League.
Marine Pollution Protocol
Message to the Senate Transmitting
the Protocol. July 25, 1977
To the Senate of the United States:
I herewith transmit for your considera-
tion the Protocol Relating to Intervention
on the High Seas in Cases of Marine Pol-
lution by Substances Other than Oil,
1973. I am also transmitting a report on
this Protocol from the Department of
State.
The Protocol complements the 1969
International Convention Relating to In-
tervention on the High Seas in Cases of
Oil Pollution Casualties by providing that,
under certain circumstances, governments
may take action on the high seas to pro-
tect the interests of their coastal areas
from marine pollution caused by sub-
stances other than oil. A list of such sub-
stances, compiled by the Inter-Govern-
mental Maritime Consultative Organiza-
tion, accompanies the Protocol. Under
the terms of the Protocol, the list can be
amended to reflect future technological
developments.
The Protocol is evidence of awareness
by the international community that oil
is not the only potential source of marine
pollution, and that steps must be taken to
prevent or reduce damage from other sub-
stances as well. I recommend that the
Senate advise and consent to its ratifi-
cation.
