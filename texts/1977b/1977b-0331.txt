last several weeks and, in all instances,
conducted himself as a gentleman and as
a man of complete integrity.
What is important is that Bert Lance
is a man of competence, of honesty, trust-
worthy, and a man of integrity, and that
his services to this country can and should
continue. Bert Lance enjoys my complete
confidence and support. I'm proud to
have him as part of my administration.
As he has been throughout, Mr. Lance
is now available to answer any questions
that you might have. As far as I'm con-
cerned, as President, the intense investiga-
tion and the Comptroller's report has an-
swered questions that were raised against
Bert Lance. And any questions that you
might have now, in addition to those an-
swered by the Comptroller or including
those, Bert will be glad to provide those
answers to you.
Bert, I'm proud of you.

A Proclamation
The past twenty-five years have been
marked by the unprecedented develop-
ment of international law as nations have
come to recognize that cooperation in in-
ternational relations is the only alternative
to chaos. This cooperation depends upon
mutual respect, which in turn depends
upon the development of legal norms

to each nation's legitimate interests, must
respect the feelings and beliefs of all peo-

and liberty in which each individual on

potential.

from every corner of the globe will gather
