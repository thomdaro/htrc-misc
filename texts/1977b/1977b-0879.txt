MODIFICATION OF TARIFFS ON CERTAIN
SUGARS, SIRUPS, AND MOLASSES
By the President of the United States
of America
A Proclamation
(19
1. By Proclamation 4334, of Novem-
ber 16, 1974, the President modified Sub-
part A, Part 10, Schedule 1 of the Tariff
Schedules of the United States
U.S.C. 1202, hereinafter referred to as
the "TSUS") to establish, effective Jan-
uary 1, 1975, following expiration of the
Sugar Act of 1948, a rate of duty and
quota applicable to sugars, sirups and mo-
lasses described in items 155.20 and 155.30
of the TSUS. By Proclamation 4463 of
September 21, 1976, as amended by Proc-
lamation 4466, of October 4, 1976, the
President modified the rate of duty appli-
cable to such sugars, sirups and molasses.
2. The President took these actions pur-
suant to authority vested in him by the
Constitution and statutes of the United
States, including section 201(a)(2) of
the Trade Expansion Act of 1962 (19
U.S.C. 1821(a) (2)), and in conformity
with Headnote 2 of Subpart A of Part 10
of Schedule 1 of the TSUS, hereinafter
referred to as the "Headnote". The
Headnote was part of a trade agreement
that embodied the results of the "Ken-
nedy Round" of international trade nego-
tiations. That agreement is known for-
mally as the 1967 Geneva Protocol to the
General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade,
and the agreement includes, as an Annex,
"Schedule XX", a schedule of United
States trade concessions made during
those negotiations. This agreement was
concluded pursuant to section 201 (a) of
the Trade Expansion Act of 1962 (19
U.S.C. 1821 (a)), and was implemented
by Proclamation No. 3822, of December
16, 1967, (82 Stat. 1455) which, inter
alia, added the Headnote to the TSUS.
3. The Headnote provides, in relevant
part, as follows:
"(i) . . . if the President finds that a par-
ticular rate not lower than such January 1,
1968, rate, limited by a particular quota, may
be established for any articles provided for in
item 155.20 or 155.30, which will give due con-
sideration to the interests in the United States
sugar market of domestic producers and mate-
rially affected contracting parties to the Gen-
eral Agreement on Tariffs and Trade, he shall
proclaim such particular rate and such quota
limitation,
â€œ(ii) . . . any rate and quota limitation so
established shall be modified if the President
finds and proclaims that such modification is
2021
