You, too, Mr. President, showed that
you
have patience. So some patience must
be guarded, because it's an historical con-
flict; it is not a territorial problem. For
19 years there was no peace. For 19 years
we didn't have the second part of
Jerusalem or the Golan Heights, not one
day of peace.

At the time, ladies and gentlemen, the
British used to say, because of their own
reasons, thank God for the French Army.
Now, paraphrasing that saying, I will
raise my glass and say with all my heart,
thank God for America.
To the President of the United States,
the leader and defender of the free
world: Lechayim.
The question arises: Why not? Were
it a territorial conflict, there was no rea-
son not to make peace with Israel. It is
an historical conflict. We came there. We
have come there by right to the land of
our ancestors. But it was not recognized,
and time and again attempts were made Captive Nations Week, 1977
to destroy us.
NOTE: The President spoke at 9:02 p.m. in the
State Dining Room at the White House.
Sometimes you have a defeated ag-
gressor claiming that he's the wronged
victim. But we know what happened. We
only defended ourselves against attempts,
repeated, to destroy our people, our
dream and our independence and, ulti-
mately, our lives.
With a sense of urgency on one hand
and some patience on the other, I think
we can build a foundation of peace in the
Middle East and the recognition of jus-
tice for all and fairness for all, as we
believe.
We don't hate our neighbors. We don't
want to humiliate them at all. We never
wanted to defeat them. We never wanted
to wrong them. But we had to defend our-
selves. This is the whole story, as they
used to say in those ancient days, on one
foot. I can only speak very shortly stand-
ing on one foot, the whole story.
We are hopeful; we are optimistic. We
have to be. Our people have always been
optimistic.
So, Mr. President, the day after tomor-
row I will be leaving Washington with a
staunch heart, grateful for your gracious
hospitality, for your friendship, for the en-
Proclamation 4513. July 20, 1977
By the President of the United States
of America
A Proclamation
Since 1959 the Congress, by joint
resolution (73 Stat. 212), has authorized
and requested the President to designate
the third week in July as Captive Nations
Week.
Our own country was established on a
profound belief in national self-determi-
nation. Throughout our history we have
sought to give meaning to this principle
and to our belief in liberty and human
rights.
In recognition of this commitment,
Now, THEREFORE, I, JIMMY CARTER,
President of the United States of Amer-
ica, do hereby designate the week begin-
ning July 17, 1977, as Captive Nations
Week.
I call upon the people of the United
States to observe this week with appro-
priate ceremonies and activities, demon-
strating America's support for those who
seek national independence, liberty, and
human rights.
