Administration of Jimmy Carter, 1977
vided by you and your colleagues on the
Board of Visitors. Please convey to each
member of the Board my deep apprecia-
tion for his contribution to the report.
As you are aware, U.S. law requires
the Board to examine academic and ad-
ministrative procedures at the Academy,
as well as physical and fiscal matters. In
light of recent difficulties experienced at
the Academy, I would hope the Board's
report for April 1978 and subsequent
years will focus more on academic and
other training matters. I believe that
your
group offers a critical source of outside
and expert evaluation, and I count on
your judgment to help guide West Point
in maintaining the high standards re-
quired to produce dedicated leadership
for the United States Army.
Please accept my thanks for providing
your distinguished and knowledgeable
leadership as Chairman of the Board of
Visitors.
Sincerely,
JIMMY CARTER
