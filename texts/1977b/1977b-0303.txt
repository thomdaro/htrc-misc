COSTS
In my May 2, 1977 statement I estab-
lished as a goal that the new reformed
system involve no higher initial cost than
the present system. It was my belief that
fundamental reform was possible within
the confines of current expenditures if the
system were made more rational and effi-
cient. That belief has been borne out in
our planning. Thereafter, Secretary Cal-
ifano outlined a tentative no cost plan
which embodied the major reform we
have been seeking:
-Consolidation of programs.
-Incentives to work.
-Provision of jobs.
-Establishment of a national mini-
mum payment.
-Streamlined administration.
-Incentives to keep families together.
-Some fiscal relief for State and local
governments.
Subsequently, we have consulted with
State and local officials and others who
are knowledgeable in this area. As a result
of those consultations we have gone be-
yond the no cost plan to one with modest
additional cost in order to provide more
jobs, particularly for current AFDC fam-
ily heads, additional work incentives,
broader coverage for needy families
and greater fiscal relief for states and
localities.
The Program For Better Jobs and In-
come will replace $26.3 billion in current
programs which provide income assist-
ance to low-income people. In addition,
the program will produce savings in other
programs amounting to $1.6 billion. The
total amount available from replaced
programs and savings is $27.9 billion.

of the wellhead tax revenues to taxpayers
through the income tax system and to "the
poor who do not pay taxes" in effect through
income maintenance programs.

nor reduce the amount of cash assistance paid
to residents of subsidized housing. It is mere-
ly an estimate of the savings to the Depart-
ment of Housing and Urban Development's
housing subsidy programs on account of high-
er incomes going to tenants under the new
program.

curity Tax, nor does it take any money out of
the Social Security Trust Funds. It merely
recognizes that the millions of people taken
off of dependence on welfare and given a job
will become contributors to the Social Security
System.
