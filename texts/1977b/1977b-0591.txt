Administration of Jimmy Carter, 1977
Oct. 5
The dispute over these claims goes back into
prior administrations. It has resulted in years
of expensive and inconclusive litigation between
the States and the Federal Government. It has
been a nagging irritant in the relations be-
tween HEW and the States.
The dispute began in the early 1970's when
HEW took two actions: (1) it refused to pay
19 of the States some $1.56 billion in social
services claims; and (2) it sought reimburse-
ment from 13 of these 19 States, plus 9 other
States, of Federal funds already paid to the
States for social services.
The focus of the dispute has chiefly been over
the types of social services for which the Federal
Government should reimburse the States and
whether certain State procedures were proper.
These services were covered under the old
Titles I, IV, VI, X, XIV, and XVI of the
Social Security Act, which became obsolete on
October 1, 1975, when Title XX became ef-
fective. Title XX of the Social Security Act is
the new consolidated Title authorizing Federal
payments for social services provided by the
States.
The social services covered such areas as day
care for children, protective services for ne-
glected or abused children, drug and alcohol
abuse services, counseling on family planning,
and a variety of services for aged, blind, or dis-
abled persons.
The agreement now reached would pay, on
a formula worked out between the Department
and the States, a portion of the pending un-
paid claims. In addition, 22 affected States
will not be asked for reimbursement of funds
already given them. (See attached table.)
The amounts to be paid to the States may be
adjusted slightly if existing claims by the States
are adjusted, or if additional claims are filed.
