Administration of Jimmy Carter, 1977
required or appropriate to give effect to the
above considerations;

وو
4. Section 201 (a) (2) of the Trade Ex-
pansion Act authorizes the President to
proclaim the modification or continuance
of any existing duty or other import re-
strictions, or such additional import re-
strictions as he determines to be required
or appropriate to carry out any trade
agreement entered into under the author-
ity of that Act, except that pursuant to
section 201 (b) (2) of the Act, the Presi-
dent may not by proclamation increase a
rate of duty to a rate more than 50%
above the rate existing on July 1, 1934.
The currently applicable tariff rates in
rate column numbered 2 for sugars, sirups,
and molasses, described in items 155.20
and 155.30, are treated as the rates "ex-
isting on July 1, 1934", for the purposes of
the President's proclaiming authority.
5. General headnote 4 (b) of the TSUS
provides that a rate of duty proclaimed
pursuant to a concession granted in a
trade agreement shall be reflected in the
column numbered 1 of the TSUS and, if
higher than the then existing rate in col-
umn numbered 2, shall also be reflected in
the latter column.
6. I find that the modifications herein-
after proclaimed of the rates of duty ap-
plicable to items 155.20 and 155.30 of the
TSUS are appropriate to carry out that
portion of the Kennedy Round trade
agreement set forth in the Headnote, and
as provided for therein, give due consid-
eration to the interests in the United
States sugar market of domestic producers
and materially affected contracting parties
to the General Agreement on Tariffs and
Trade.
Now, THEREFORE, I, JIMMY CARTER,
President of the United States of America,
acting under the authority vested in me by
the Constitution and statutes, including
section 201 of the Trade Expansion Act of
1962, and pursuant to General Headnote
4(b), and Headnote 2, Subpart A of Part
10 of Schedule 1, of the TSUS, do hereby
proclaim until otherwise superseded by
law:
A. The rates of duty in rate columns
numbered 1 and 2 for items 155.20 and
155.30 of Subpart A, Part 10, Schedule 1
of the TSUS, are modified, and the fol-
lowing rates are established:
155.20______2.98125¢
per lb. less
0.0421875¢ per lb. for each
degree under 100 degrees
(and fractions of a degree
in proportion) but not
less than 1.9265625¢ per
lb.
155.30______dutiable on total sugars at the
rate per lb. applicable un-
der Item 155.20 to sugar
testing 100 degrees.
B. Those parts of Proclamation 4334 of
November 16, 1974, Proclamation 4463 of
September 21, 1976, and Proclamation
4466 of October 4, 1976, which are incon-
sistent with the provisions of paragraph
(A) above are hereby terminated.
C. The provisions of this Proclamation
shall apply to articles entered, or with-
drawn from warehouse, for consumption
on and after the date of this Proclamation.
However, the provisions of this Proclama-
tion shall not apply to articles (a) ex-
ported to the United States before 12:01
A.M. (U.S. Eastern Standard Time), on
the date of this Proclamation, or (b) im-
ported to fulfill forward contracts entered
into before 12:01 A.M. (U.S. Eastern
Standard Time), on the date of this Proc-
lamation, Provided, that articles re-
ferred to in (a) and (b) above are en-
tered, or withdrawn from warehouse, for
