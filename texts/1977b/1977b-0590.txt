9. Mitchell-Lama Housing
The Federal Government is in the proc-
ess of insuring Mitchell-Lama housing
projects, which will enable the city to raise
$280 million in 1978 either through the
sale of the projects or issuance of bonds.
10. Child Health Assessment
The administration's proposed Child
Health Assessment Program, if enacted
by Congress, in Federal fiscal year 1978,
will provide $8.8 million in increased
health services for children in New York
City. This program is a major reform of
Medicaid's periodic diagnostic program
for children.
11. Welfare Reform
The administration's welfare reform
package will result in an estimated $525
million in fiscal relief to New York State
with approximately $175 million of that
going to New York City. This added relief
would be effective in 1981 under the pro-
posal.
12. Fuel Bill Payments
A new program under the Community
Services Administration assists people who
had difficulty meeting last winter's large
fuel bills. Of the $200 million available,
$21.1 million went to New York State,
including $1.1 million to New York City,
to supplement other funds also available
to help city residents.

revenues.
DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE RETROACTIVE
SOCIAL SERVICES CLAIMS SETTLEMENT
President Carter has approved an agreement,
negotiated by the Department of Health, Edu-
cation, and Welfare with State representatives,
to settle the largest outstanding financial dis-
pute between the Federal Government and the
States. The agreement involves payments to
28 States for the cost of social services provided
to low-income families and individuals from
1969 to 1975.
Under the agreement, 19 States will receive
Federal payments totaling $532 million, and 22
States (13 of them also members of the group of
19) will have Federal Government claims
against them dropped. The States, in turn, will
drop all further actions against the Federal
Government.
The Congress will be asked to authorize $543
million for the settlement. Eleven million dol-
lars will be held as a contingency figure to be
allotted as a part of the final agreement.
The action, contingent upon the approval
of Congress, is part of a settlement between
HEW and a total of 28 States of some $2.4 bil-
lion in disputed payments. Of this $2.4 billion,
$1.56 billion represented State claims that were
never paid by HEW, and the balance repre-
sented payments that had been made by HEW
but whose validity the Department disputed.
