Administration of Jimmy Carter, 1977
June 29
We are very grateful to have you here.
And I think that this is the first time
we've had a chance to have entertainment
outside on the lawn. But it's a particularly
beautiful setting, and I think that the
beauty of the setting will be matched and
even exceeded by the beauty of the per-
formances.
Thank you very much.
NOTE: The President spoke at approximately
10:20 p.m. on the South Lawn of the White
House.
