Gerald R. Ford, 1976
But now it seems to me, as we enter our third century, we have to make sure
that the rights of the individual—that means you and you and you and everybody
else—must be protected, that the rights of the individual should be freer in this
third century than in any other period or time in our history.
That is what we want, and that is what I will dedicate myself to for the next
4 years with your help and assistance.
Thank you very much.
NOTE: The President spoke at 5:34 p.m. in the Brazos Room at the Waco Civic Center.

THANK YOU, Bob. I want to congratulate you, Bob, for winning a great
victory for the mayorship of Dallas. And I congratulate you and wish you the
very, very best in a very important responsibility, in handling the good affairs
of the city of Dallas, and I know you will with great success.
I do want to thank Tom Landry,' who I have known for a good many years
and envied and respected, because I think Tom epitomizes the finest in Ameri-
can competitive athletics. It's nice to see both Tom and Mrs. Landry.
And then it's nice to see Mary Ellen. I have seen a lot of very beautiful young
