Gerald R. Ford, 1976
tained by the Congress, would save the taxpayers $4 billion and will help to
ward off the risks of new inflation.
While Members of Congress are home for recess, people have an excellent
opportunity to tell them just how they feel. If the American people want to hold
down Federal spending and have the additional tax cuts that I have proposed,
now is the time to say so, loud and clear.
NOTE: The President spoke at 4:10 p.m. in the Oval Office at the White House.

Veto of the Public Works Employment Act of 1976.
July 6, 1976
To the Senate of the United States:
I am today returning without my approval, S. 3201, the Public Works Em-
ployment Act of 1976.
This bill would require $3.95 billion in Federal spending above and beyond
what is necessary. It sends a clear signal to the American people that four months
before a national election, the Congress is enacting empty promises and giveaway
programs. I will not take the country down that path. Time and time again,
we have found where it leads: to larger deficits, higher taxes, higher inflation
and ultimately higher unemployment.
We must stand firm. I know the temptation, but I urge Members of Congress
to reconsider their positions and join with me now in keeping our economy on
the road to healthy, sustained growth.
It was almost five months ago that the Senate sustained my veto of a similar
bill, H.R. 5247, and the reasons compelling that veto are equally persuasive now
with respect to S. 3201. Bad policy is bad whether the inflation price tag is $4
billion or $6 billion.
Proponents of S. 3201 argue that it is urgently needed to provide new jobs. I
yield to no one in concern over the effects of unemployment and in the desire
that there be enough jobs for every American who is seeking work. To empha-
size the point, let me remind the Congress that the economic policies of this
Administration are designed to create 2-2.5 million jobs in 1976 and an addi-
tional 2 million jobs in 1977. By contrast, Administration economists estimate
that this bill, S. 3201, will create at most 160,000 jobs over the coming year-less
than 5% of what my own policies will accomplish. Moreover, the jobs created
by S. 3201 would reduce national unemployment by less than one-tenth of one
