Gerald R. Ford, 1976
grees of comfort-[laughter]â€”with potential Republican candidates. When I
pick that candidate, I expect him to be a good running mate and a good Vice
President.
Q. But you said there are no retakes in the Oval Office, indicating that he
doesn't have the experience to handle this office. And it just seems that you feel,
or have indicated, that he is not qualified to be President.
THE PRESIDENT. I think when we pick the candidate, he will be a qualified
person to be Vice President.
HEALTH OF BETTY FORD AND PAT NIXON
[18.] Q. What can you tell us this morning about the health of Mrs. Ford?
Is she feeling all right? Also, have you been in touch with the Nixon family
about the former First Lady?
The President. Mrs. Ford came down with a very bad cold yesterday fol-
lowing the church services at the [Washington National] Cathedral. She had a
good night. She is going to take it easy for a day or so, and there is no concern,
just a typical cold.
I stopped and saw Dr. Lukash when I came to the office this morning. He
had not gotten any overnight reports on the condition of Mrs. Nixon. He is
going to report to me as soon as he gets any information from her doctor.
CONVERSATION WITH FORMER PRESIDENT NIXON
[19.] Q. Did you speak to President Nixon?
THE PRESIDENT. I called President Nixon.
Q. Can you tell us something of what he told you?
The President. Well, he reported the sequence more or less as they have been
reported in the press. I extended to him on behalf of Betty and myself our affec-
tion and best wishes for Mrs. Nixon's full and complete recovery.
Q. Did you talk about politics?
THE PRESIDENT. Not at all.
REPUBLICAN NATIONAL COMMITTEE
[20.] Q. Mr. President, as I understand it, the Republican National Commit-
tee is supposed to be neutral until there is a nominee. Am I correct in that
assumption?
THE PRESIDENT. That is a valid assumption.
Rear Adm. William M. Lukash, Physician to the President.
