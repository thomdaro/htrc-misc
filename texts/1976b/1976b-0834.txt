Message to the Congress Transmitting Annual Report on
Coastal Zone Management.
To the Congress of the United States:
May 27, 1976
I am transmitting herewith the third annual report from the Secretary of
Commerce covering the significant developments that took place during the
second full year of implementation of the Coastal Zone Management Act of
1972. The period covered is Fiscal Year 1975, when the states began full devel-
opment of their coastal programs.
The country's urgent need for new domestic sources of energy and our con-
cern for minimizing environmental damage and community disruption have
combined to underscore the importance of the effort put forth in the coastal
zone program. The program points out the importance of cooperation at the
state and federal level in order to provide appropriate and timely solutions to
these important problems.
