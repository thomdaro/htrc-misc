want a candidate who can help the ticket from top to bottom. And therefore,
when they look at the cold, hard facts of the record I have achieved and, I think,
the success we will get in the November election, they will want a winner, and
that is how we will sell them.
Q. Are you going to talk to them personally?
THE PRESIDENT. We may to some.
Q. Have you started yet?
THE PRESIDENT. We have not yet.
Q. When do you plan to?
THE PRESIDENT. I have not had much time.
Q. Mr. President, some of your Cleveland supporters are threatening to
withdraw their endorsement of you unless the ads in California are removed.
Have you been informed of this?
THE PRESIDENT. I have not.
Q. Do you have any response to that?
THE PRESIDENT. I have not heard about it. I would like to find out who they
are. Nobody has talked to me about it.
Q. Right now is there any plan to pull the ads off in this final day of cam-
paigning in California?
THE PRESIDENT. None that I know of.
REPORTER. Thank you very much.
THE PRESIDENT. It is good to see you all.
NOTE: The President spoke at 2:03 p.m. in Snyder Park. In his opening remarks, he referred to Representa-
tive Clarence J. (Bud) Brown.
