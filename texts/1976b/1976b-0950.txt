Remarks Announcing New Initiatives for the Task Force on
Questionable Corporate Payments Abroad. June 14, 1976
TEN WEEKS ago, I appointed a task force headed by Secretary Richardson to
review our policies toward corporations that engage in questionable payments
to other nations. Today, based upon the findings of that task force, I am an-
nouncing three new initiatives.
First, as a deterrent to bribery by American-controlled industries, I am direct-
ing the task force to prepare legislation that would require corporate disclosure
of all payments made with the intention of influencing foreign government
officials. Failure to comply with the new disclosure laws would lead to civil and
criminal penalties.
Second, I am announcing my support of pending legislation to strengthen the
law requiring corporations to keep their shareholders fully and honestly in-
formed about their foreign behavior.
Finally, I am asking our major trading partners to work with us in reaching
agreement on a new code to govern international corporate activities.
Let me emphasize my conviction that the vast majority of American-based
corporations are honest, upstanding citizens in the international community.
Nonetheless, we must recognize that unethical behavior by only a few compa-
nies can spoil the environment for everyone. Our system of private enterprise,
a system that has provided a higher standard of living and greater economic
security than any system known to man, is under constant attack today because
many citizens no longer trust big business.
In order to renew and to restore public faith in free enterprise, we must pro-
vide the public with concrete assurance that major corporations are clean and
honest. The initiatives I am announcing today can be a big step in that direction.
Thank you very much.
NOTE: The President spoke at 11:35 am. to reporters assembled in the Briefing Room at the White House.
