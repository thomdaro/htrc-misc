FISCAL POLICY; UNEMPLOYMENT RATE
[14.] Q. Mr. President, I would like for you to comment on what your per-
sonal fiscal policy is and what it will be in the next year? I would also like to
know what you think the unemployment rate will be at the end of this year and
at the end of the next administration?
THE PRESIDENT. Let me answer the last question first. In the budget that we
submitted for fiscal year 1977, we forecast that during 1976 the unemployment
rate would end at the end of this calendar year at a rate of about 7 percent. In the
first 2 months or 3 months of 1976, the actual results have been better than we
anticipated.
I respectfully refer you back to a year ago when it was 8.9 percent. It is now,
according to the figures for March, 7.5. It is my judgment that by the end of
calendar year 1976 we will have an unemployment rate below 7 percent, and it
will continue downward in the months ahead after January 1, 1977.
Now as a fiscal policy, I submitted this year a budget that calls for a 50-percent
cut in the rate of growth in Federal expenditures. If you go back for the last 10
years and look at the Federal budgets, you will find that during that period of
time the expenditures in the Federal Government grew at a 10 to 11 percent
rate per year.
Let me illustrate what it meant in dollars. For the current fiscal year we expect
the Federal Government will spend roughly $372 or $373 billion in 13 months.
And if we don't change a program, if there is no new law passed, just more
people going on this program or that program or the cost-of-living escalators in
the many programs, the rate of growth in dollars in the Federal budget will be
over $50 billion in 12 months. That is just the growth factor at a 10 to 11 percent
increase.
We can't sustain, we can't justify that kind of growth. So, I recommended
a budget for fiscal year 1977 that cuts that growth rate in half from 10 to 11
percent down to 5 to 51Â½ percent and set a spending ceiling of $394.4 billion.
Now, tragically, the Congress and the two budget committees have already
added to that spending figure by-well, from 394 to 413 to 414. So, that is the
practical problem we face.
I can assure you that we are going to do our utmost to hold the spending line
at the figure that I indicated-$394.4 billion-and we are going to veto, as we
have in the past, any expenditures over the budgeted figures. And as you look at
