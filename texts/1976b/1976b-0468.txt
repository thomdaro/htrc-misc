Public Papers of the Presidents
think are in the best interests of your community, your State, and our country.
So, I am proud of my previous association-Billy, and the new president—of
my opportunities as a member of the Jaycees.
Now, let me just—this is my last speech or comment before leaving the great
State of Texas as I've had a wonderful time here for 3 days. I've met some
wonderful folks, young and old, from all walks of life, who have been friendly
and supportive. And I want to say to you directly, and you can say it to all the
other people of this great State, that Betty and Jack and Steve and Susan and
Mike and myself are grateful for the hospitality, for the friendship, and the
support that all of you have given us.
And I can only say this: The Ford family, and I particularly, will never let
you down if I have the opportunity to serve this country for another 4 years.
Thank you very, very much.
Again, it is nice to see you, and good luck, and God bless each and every one of
you.
NOTE: The President spoke at 7:34 pm. at the
Abil: ne Civic Center after being presented the kev
to the city of Abilene by Mayor Fred Lee Hughes. In
his remarks, he referred to Bill Tavlor, president of
the Abilene Jaycees.

Memorandum to the Special Representative for Trade
Negotiations on Import Relief for the Earthenware Industry.
April 30, 1976
PURSUANT to Section 203(h)(3) of the Trade Act of 1974 (P.L. 93–618, 88
Stat. 1978), I have determined the actions I will take with respect to the report
of the United States International Trade Commission (USITC), dated March
31, 1976, concerning the results of its investigation of a petition for continuation
of import relief filed by the American Dinnerware Emergency Committee.
I have decided to extend the increased rates of duty currently in effect on im-
ports of certain earthen dinnerware, and certain other ceramic tableware pro-
vided for in items 923.01, 923.07pt. (that part related to item 533.38), 923.13 and
923.15 of the TSUSA for one year. These temporary duty increases will subse-
quently be phased-down and will revert to trade agreement rates beginning
May 1, 1979, unless terminated before that time. Escape action rates of duty
on steins and mugs and certain other ceramic tableware, provided for in items
923.03, 923.11, 923.05 and 923.07pt. respectively of the TSUSA, will revert to
1400
