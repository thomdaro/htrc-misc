Gerald R. Ford, 1976
—I transmitted a drug abuse message to the Congress on April 27, 1976,¹
which included, among others, proposals for strengthening law enforce-
ment efforts.
-The Cabinet officers have placed priority attention on strengthening their
drug abuse organizations.
Future Actions. My Administration plans to strengthen its efforts against the
drug abuse problem.
-The Cabinet Committee for Drug Law Enforcement has held its first
meeting and the Cabinet Committee on Drug Abuse Prevention, Treat-
ment, and Rehabilitation will be fully operational within a month. The
Office of Management and Budget and the agencies involved will provide
the necessary support to the Cabinet Committees.
-Over the next month, Cabinet officers will contact the Congressional com-
mittees with drug abuse responsibilities to discuss the agenda from the
Cabinet Committees.
-The agencies affected by the recommendations of the White Paper will pro-
vide me with a full status report when they submit their budget requests for
fiscal year 1978 this September.
In summary, the Office of Drug Abuse Policy is an example of unnecessary
growth in the Federal bureaucracy, and should not be established. It is the re-
sponsibility of public officials to guard against the unwarranted or inefficient use
of public funds. I am, therefore, asking that the Congress rescind the funds for
the Office of Drug Abuse Policy.
The details of the proposed rescission are contained in the attached report.
