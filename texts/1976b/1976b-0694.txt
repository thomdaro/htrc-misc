Remarks at a Meeting To Report on U.S. Disaster Assistance to
Italy. May 17, 1976
THE PRESIDENT. I have asked the Vice President and Mr. Parker' to come in
and give me a firsthand report on the AID [Agency for International Develop-
ment] request that I made to the Congress to help the earthquake victims in
Italy. And, as all of you know, the Vice President and Dan Parker went to
Italy to see firsthand the devastation that came from the earthquake, to talk
to the people, to work with the government, and to show firsthand that this
administration is very, very concerned and willing to help in trying to alleviate
the suffering and participate in the rebuilding.
So, Mr. Vice President, would you give us a quick summary of what you
saw?
THE VICE PRESIDENT. Let me just take us back a little, Mr. President. You
have done a lot of wonderful things for people in your life, but of all the things
you have done, I don't think anything has ever reached people the way this
'Daniel Parker, Administrator, Agency for International Development.
