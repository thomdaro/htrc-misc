Gerald R. Ford, 1976
ployment for the industry in 1975 was 163,000 workers, compared to 178,000
for the year 1974. For the first two months of 1976 the monthly average is
172,000, the highest since July 1974.
Meanwhile, imports of the nonrubber footwear covered by the USITC rec-
ommendation (all except zoris and paper slippers) have been leveling off. In
February, 1976, there were 29,238,000 pairs, down from 32,200,000 in January.
In considering the effect of import restraints on the International economic
interests of the United States, as required by the Trade Act of 1974, I have con-
cluded that such restraints would be contrary to the U.S. policy of promoting
the development of an open, nondiscriminatory and fair world economic sys-
tem. The goal of this policy is to expand domestic employment and living stand-
ards through increased economic efficiency.
I have directed the Secretaries of Commerce and Labor to give expeditious
consideration to any petitions for adjustment assistance filed by footwear firms
producing articles covered by the USITC report, and their workers. I have also
instructed the Secretaries to file supplementary budget requests for adjustment
assistance funds, if necessary, to carry out my program.
I have also directed the Special Representative for Trade Negotiations to
monitor U.S. footwear trade, watching both the levels and quantities of imports
as well as of domestic production and employment. If significant changes oc-
cur, they will be reported to me with appropriate recommendations.
