GOOD AFTERNOON, ladies and gentlemen.
It is great to be in Atlanta. We had a wonderful day and a half in Indiana,
we are looking forward to an opportunity of being here in Georgia today.
So, with those observations I will be glad to answer any questions.
REPORTER. Welcome-welcome back.
THE PRESIDENT. My ninth time in recent years.
Q. Mr. President, recently in Texas you played the role of underdog and you
said even more recently should you lose Texas it could affect your chances in
neighboring States, one of those was Georgia, I believe. Do you feel like you

we started in Texas as an underdog, we are making very substantial headway. I

Q. Mr. President, do you think you will win in Georgia?
THE PRESIDENT. Well, I am always hopeful, and we are going to try very hard.
Q. Mr. President, is there any possibility that you might ask Vice President

visit-whether it is purely political or whether you are here as President. Some
of your Democratic opponents from DeKalb County, where you will speak to
night, will not attend that because they say you are coming as a candidate and
not as a President.
THE PRESIDENT. Well, I very deeply regret their attitude. I think I might learn
