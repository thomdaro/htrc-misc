Public Papers of the Presidents
won't let you down. And I know you will make a maximum effort, and those
clouds on Sunday could look awful bright, and I think they might.
Thank you very much.
NOTE: The President spoke at 7.53 a.m. in the Imperial Ballroom West at the Hyatt Regency Hotel.

The President's News Conference of
April 29, 1976
THE PRESIDENT. Good morning. Won't you all sit down.
It's been great in Texas for the last 2 days. We are looking forward to a couple
more. So, let's get started this morning.
QUESTIONS
RONALD REAGAN
[1] Q. I would like to ask you about what you said yesterday about Mr.
Reagan. Does this represent a new turn in the campaign, where you and he will
take on each other directly, confront each other directly and personally?
The President. It's not a question of personalities. It's a question of which
candidate has the best policies, the best programs; which candidate is the one
that is better qualified to do the job. And that is really the issue, what the people
in Texas have to decide and what the people throughout the rest of the country
must decide.
We have laid out our program, which is a very complete and a very detailed
program both at home and abroad, a program with a record. And my opponent
is coming up with some rather simple, some rather lacking-in-detail answers,
and I think the people in Texas must decide it on those policies rather than
on personality.
Q. Why do you not refer to him by name?
THE PRESIDENT. That is sort of a tradition you do in politics.
JIMMY CARTER
[2.] Q. Mr. President, Dick Growald, UPI.
Mr. President, you said you would welcome a battle in November between
yourself and Senator Humphrey as providing a clear battle issue of philosophy.
