the 1974 Coach of the Year Award from the American Football Coaches Asso-
ciation last year.
Baylor has a very great right to be proud of Coach Teaff, and I congratulate
him as well as you. Now, before I go any further, to all of you CB'ers in the
audience, I bring a special hello from First Mama-[laughter]â€”and second-
arily from First Papa, too.
But, I am deeply grateful to have the opportunity to meet with you today,
and you know they say anything is possible in Texas. I always leave this great
State with a great optimism and a very positive attitude. But, before I get to
your questions, let me say a few words concerning the future of our country.
We have come a long, long way since the birth of the United States two cen-

We must not smother the individual expression and creativity that exists
in each and every one of us, and we must not stifle individual opportunity.
