Public Papers of the Presidents
that this proposed legislation is constitutional; it will simply limit the remedy
to the instance where there has been a violation of a constitutional right. Ac-
cording to him, that is constitutional.
MR. SCHIEFFER. And it is your interpretation that the Keyes case did not in-
validate
THE PRESIDENT. As I understand it, it was a dictum, not a final judgment.

MR. HERMAN. So that this is the direction which you wish to encourage law

MISS THOMAS. But isn't it the law of the land to desegregate the schools in this
land?
THE PRESIDENT. Where there has been a specific violation of a person's
constitutional right. It is not beyond that, and that is the real point at issue.
MISS THOMAS. On another subject, Mr. Presidentâ€”
