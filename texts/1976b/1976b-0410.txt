of any country, including the United States-that, of course, is how we became
a country-and secondly, that under any and all circumstances this country
stands for the full protection of minority rights.
At the same time, the Secretary has clearly stated to all of Africa that the
United States does not believe that any foreign powers outside of Africa should

going to win on Saturday, May 1, here in Texas; we are going to win in Kansas
City; we are going to win November 2 and go right on winning for America
for the next century.
When I became President about 21 months ago, our great country, the United
States of America, was faced with some very serious concerns. Runaway infla-
