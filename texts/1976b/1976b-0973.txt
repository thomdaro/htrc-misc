continue our role as a party to try and achieve the long-sought peace and security
in the Middle East.
Q. One other question. The role of the PLO [Palestine Liberation Organiza-
tion] is a little unclear to us. Can you clarify that at all?
THE PRESIDENT. The PLO and all other parties in the Lebanon area have
cooperated completely in making it possible for us to evacuate the Americans
and the other nationals without any incident whatsoever.
NOTE: The exchange began at 1:20 p.m. in the Rose Garden at the White House.

Exchange With Reporters on Arrival at Indianapolis, Indiana.
June 22, 1976
IT'S nice to be back in Indianapolis, Indiana, Governor Bowen, Mayor Hudnut,
and the Jaycees.
I will be glad to answer any questions.
REPORTER. Mr. President, is the Federal Government going to participate in
any way in the investigation into Don Bolles' ยน death?
THE PRESIDENT. The Federal Government will do whatever it is authorized to
do in any way whatsoever, either initiating any activity or working with local
authorities.
Q. We have no specific plans, though?
THE PRESIDENT. I can't tell you at the present time. It's a deplorable, despicable
act, and we certainly will maximize our effort in any way possible.
Q. Mr. President, some months ago the Indianapolis School Board had writ-
ten to you requesting that you help along with the school desegregation plan.
Do you have any word for them as yet?
THE PRESIDENT. I am going to make some comments today, during my re-
marks, about the proposal that I am submitting to the Congress this week which,
I think, will minimize court-ordered busing and will provide a means and a
method to help local authorities in trying to handle the problem at the local
level.
Q. Mr. President, what do you think the chances are of winning the nomina-
tion on the first ballot?
Reporter for the Arizona Republic, who was killed on June 2 allegedly because of his investigations
into organized crime.
