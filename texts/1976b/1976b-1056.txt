percent in any year. The actual projection is that the effect would be .06 percent,
at a cost of $4 billion. Thus, the heart of the debate over this bill is not over who
cares the most-we all care a great deal-but over the best way to reach our goal.
When I vetoed H.R. 5247 last February, I pointed out that it was unwise to
stimulate even further an economy which was showing signs of a strong and
steady recovery. Since that time the record speaks for itself. The present 7.5 per-
cent unemployment rate is a full one percent lower than the average unemploy-
ment rate of 8.5 percent last year. More importantly, almost three and a half
million more Americans now have jobs than was the case in March of last year.
We have accomplished this while at the same time reducing inflation which
plunged the country into the severe recession of 1975.
S. 3201 would authorize almost $4 billion in additional Federal spending-$2
billion for public works, $1.25 billion for countercyclical aid to state and local
governments, and $700 million for EPA waste water treatment grants.
Beyond the intolerable addition to the budget, S. 3201 has several serious de-
ficiencies. First, relatively few new jobs would be created. The bill's sponsors
estimate that S. 3201 would create 325,000 new jobs but, as pointed out above, our
estimates indicate that at most some 160,000 work-years of employment would
be created-and that would be over a period of several years. The peak impact
would come in late 1977 or 1978 and would add no more than 50,000 to 60,000
new jobs in any year.
Second, S. 3201 would create few new jobs in the immediate future. With peak
impact on jobs in late 1977 or early 1978, this legislation would add further
stimulus to the economy at precisely the wrong time: when the economy is al-
ready far into the recovery.
Third, the cost of producing jobs under this bill would be intolerably high,
probably in excess of $25,000 per job.
Fourth, this bill would be inflationary since it would increase Federal spend-
ing and consequently the budget deficit by as much as $1.5 billion in 1977 alone.
It would increase demands on the economy and on the borrowing needs of the
government when those demands are least desirable. Basic to job creation in
the private sector is reducing the ever increasing demands of the Federal gov-
ernment for funds. Federal government borrowing to support deficit spending
reduces the amount of money available for productive investment at a time when
many experts are predicting that we face a shortage of private capital in the fu-
ture. Less private investment means fewer jobs and less production per worker.
Paradoxically, a bill designed as a job creation measure may, in the long run,
place just the opposite pressures on the economy.
