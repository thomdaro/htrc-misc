of the extraordinarily broad human ties between Italy and the United States
of America, and the shared values and goals which bind together the Italian
and American peoples. Now, at a time when natural disaster has brought such
great tragedy to the people of Italy, Americans everywhere are moved to respond
quickly and in the spirit of profound friendship between our countries.
The request I have sent to the Congress for $25 million in disaster relief assist-
ance will enable us immediately to translate our concern into action to help
alleviate the suffering in Italy.

Father of the Year Award. May 11, 1976
FIRST, I want to congratulate the Multiple Sclerosis Society for its long and
very helpful record of trying to highlight the problems relating to MS and
also to make the American people aware of the great courage and strength of
people such as you, Mrs. Van Meter and Mr. Rikard.
I do wish to congratulate you, and it's an honor for me to give you this plaque
as Mother of the Year. We are delighted to have you here and are very glad that
you could be here.
And you, Mr. Rikard, I'm very pleased to award you this plaque as the Father
of the Year for MS. Good luck, and God bless you. It's nice to have you here.
We're delighted to have somebody from Alabama and somebody from Iowa.
The very best to both of you.
I congratulate the members of the society and what you have done and what I
know you will do in the months and years ahead.
The best to all of you. We are very grateful, on behalf of 215 million Ameri-
cans, for the achievements in the past as well as well into the future.
The very best to you.
