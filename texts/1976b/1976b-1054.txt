Special Message to the Congress Reporting on Budget Deferrals.
July 6, 1976
To the Congress of the United States:
In accordance with the Impoundment Control Act of 1974, I herewith report
two new deferrals totaling $4.6 million in budget authority. In addition, I am
transmitting 27 supplementary deferrals that have a net effect of decreasing the
total amount of deferred funds previously transmitted by $1,462.5 million.
The two new deferrals are routine actions and involve $135,938 for the Special
foreign currency program of the Department of Labor and $4.4 million for the
National Commission for the Observance of International Women's Year.
Eighteen of the supplementary reports extend deferrals into the transition quar-
ter while the remaining nine reflect increases to the amounts originally reported.
The details of the revised and new deferrals are contained in the attached
reports.
The White House,
July 6, 1976.

NOTE: The attachments detailing the deferral, are printed in the Federal Register of July 8, 1976 (41 FR

down the road to bigger and bigger giveaway programs. The American people
want and deserve something far better, such as the additional tax cuts that I
proposed to begin July 1.
I am announcing today my decision to veto the public works jobs bill, which
is the biggest spending bill left behind by the Congress. This bill would not
create lasting jobs but would create new inflationary pressures. The veto, if sus-
