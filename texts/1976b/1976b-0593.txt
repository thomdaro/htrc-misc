Remarks at Ceremonies Opening the Armed Forces Week
Exhibit. May 10, 1976
Secretary Rumsfeld, members of the Cabinet, Members of the Congress, mem-

We meet here today in America at a time of peace, but we meet in the shadow
of a monument to one who said: â€œTo be prepared for war is one of the most

muscle and brawn, the sinew and blood and bone of those who serve in our
Armed Forces.

of weapons must not distract us from the quality of those who are trained to use
them. Military history has demonstrated over and over again that the character
of a nation's soldiers and their commanders determines military strength more

and devoted to the American ideals of peace and freedom that they may be
called upon to defend. Such soldiers have no price tag. How can we measure
the value of an American who has suffered or died for freedom? Or how much
was a Grant or a Lee, a Patton or a Nimitz or an Eisenhower worth?
We owe these people our eternal thanks and graditude. We owe them our
