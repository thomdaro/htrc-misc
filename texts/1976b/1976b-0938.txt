Message to the Congress Transmitting Annual Report on the
Administration of the Radiation Control for Health and Safety
Act of 1968. June 9, 1976
To the Congress of the United States:
I transmit herewith the 1975 annual report on the administration of the
Radiation Control for Health and Safety Act (Public Law 90-602), as prepared
by the Secretary of the Department of Health, Education, and Welfare.
The report's only recommendation is that the requirement for the report
itself, as contained in P.L. 90-602, be repealed. All of the information found
in the report is available to Congress on a more immediate basis through
congressional committee oversight and budget hearings. The Department of
Health, Education, and Welfare has concluded that this annual report serves
little useful purpose and diverts agency resources from more productive
activities.
The White House,
June 9, 1976.
NOTE: The 97-page report, prepared by the De-
partment of Health, Education, and Welfare, is
entitled "1975 Annual Report-Administration of
GERALD R. FORD
the Radiation Control for Health and Safety Act
of 1968, Public Law 90-602, April 1, 1976."

Exchange With Reporters on the Results of the New Jersey, Ohio,
and California Primary Elections. June 9, 1976
THIS WEDNESDAY is a little better than a couple we have had. In fact, it's
a very good day because we had, I think, an excellent day yesterday in New
Jersey. We have a minimum of 65 out of 67 and a distinct possibility that we
will get the extra 2. In Ohio-and I just finished talking to Governor Rhodes 'â€”
we have 91 out of 97, and one of the districts is very, very close, and there is
a distinct possibility that we could pick up that one.
So, the net result is we are getting very close to the thousand delegate count.
We are 150 or so shy of the necessary 1,130. But it's getting better and better,
'Gov. James A. Rhodes of Ohio.
