Exchange With Reporters on Arrival at Freeland, Michigan.
May 16, 1976
IT IS great to be at the Tri-City Airport of Midland, Saginaw, and Bay City. We
have had a great day and a half in Michigan. It's very encouraging, and we are
very optimistic.
As I say on many occasions, I think the voters of Michigan will respond to
what we have done. We have produced the peace. We have turned the economy
around, and we have restored the faith and trust of the American people. Those
are all strong and, I think, very sound assets for America in this very difficult
time.
I will be glad to answer any questions.
REPORTER. How big do you think you might win by on Tuesday, Mr.
President?
THE PRESIDENT. I never make a point spread. I think we will do very, very
well. I think the people of Michigan know what we have done under the most
difficult circumstances, and we are counting on their support.
Q. Mr. President, can your campaign survive a loss in Michigan?
THE PRESIDENT. Ann [Ann Compton, ABC News], we aren't planning on it.
So as long as it isn't planned on, doesn't take place, I really don't think it is a
matter that we ought to be concerned about.
REPORTER. Okay, thank you.
THE PRESIDENT. Thank you all very, very much.
NOTE: The exchange began at 2:56 p.m. at Tri-City Airport.

Remarks at a Bicentennial Celebration in Saginaw, Michigan.
May 16, 1976
Thank you very, very much, Al Cederberg-my good friend Guy Vander Jagt,
the Congressman from the western part of the State is here-George Olson,
Mr. Ferguson, Mr. Kennedy, Reverend Beck, distinguished guests, ladies and
gentlemen:
May I say at the outset, I hope I have as many friends in this audience as George
Olson and Al Cederberg have. [Laughter]
It is a great privilege and pleasure for Betty and Susan and myself to be here
