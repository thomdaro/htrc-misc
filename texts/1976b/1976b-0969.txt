Gerald R. Ford, 1976
And I am an optimist. I think the Republicans can learn. I think Republicans
can move forward. Republicans can have a vision and they can be above
personalities. They can be above some differences. It is our responsibility as
Americans that is more important than any of the other things that sometimes
seem to get the headlines.
Thank you very, very much.
NOTE: The President spoke at 4:26 p.m. in the Rose Garden at the White House.

Statement on the Evacuation of American Citizens From
Lebanon. June 18, 1976
DUE to the continuing uncertainty of the situation in Beirut, I have directed
the United States Embassy there to assist in the departure, by overland convoy
to Damascus, of U.S. citizens who wish to depart Lebanon at this time.
The convoy is expected to leave Beirut Saturday, and American citizens are
being alerted both by the Embassy and by broadcast on the Voice of America
to be prepared for departure at that time, if they so wish.
The remains of Ambassador Francis Meloy and Mr. Robert Waring have
been brought to Damascus overland. They will be picked up by a U.S. plane
and returned to the United States, arriving on Saturday.
Only those Embassy officials not essential to our continuing operations will
be leaving Lebanon. The American Embassy in Beirut is to remain open to
continue our efforts to help bring an end to the strife which has brought this
tragedy to Lebanon.
