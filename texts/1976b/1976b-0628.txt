Council on Wage and Price Stability. May 13, 1976
To the Congress of the United States:
In accordance with section 5 of the Council on Wage and Price Stability Act,
as amended, I hereby transmit to the Congress the sixth quarterly report of the
Council on Wage and Price Stability. This report contains a description of the
Council activities during the first quarter of 1976 in monitoring both prices and
wages in the private sector and various Federal Government activities that lead
to higher costs and prices without creating commensurate benefits. It discusses
in some detail the Council's studies of collective bargaining negotiations for
1976, bakery and cereal products, automobiles, coal and the postal service, as
well as its filings before various Federal regulatory agencies.
