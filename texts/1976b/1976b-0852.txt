Remarks Announcing Plans for an Economic Conference in
Puerto Rico. June 3, 1976
I AM pleased to announce this morning that the leaders of six other major,
industrialized nations have accepted the invitation of the United States to at-
tend a summit conference later this month.
The conference will be held June 27 and June 28 in the Commonwealth of
Puerto Rico. In addition to the United States, Canada, France, West Germany,
Italy, Japan, and the United Kingdom will be represented.
I have invited them to participate in this meeting because it is vital that the
leaders of the industrialized democracies continue a process of close consultation
as well as cooperation on the broad range of challenges as well as opportunities
in all fields of common interest.
In the past, world leaders have met to deal with crises, but today's complex
problems require that leaders meet to avoid them.
Last fall when we met in Rambouillet, France,' we agreed to extensive co-
operation in order to sustain the economic recovery. This has meant less inflation
and more jobs for millions and millions of people throughout the world.
Now we must meet again to chart a course that will keep the recovery moving
forward at a healthy and sustained rate. There will be many other subjects of
international significance on the agenda in Puerto Rico, including financial,
monetary, and trade issues. But the issue at the heart of the discussions is to de-
termine what our nations can do, working together, to create a more prosperous
and secure future for all of our citizens.
Thank you.
NOTE: The President spoke at 11:13 a.m. in the Briefing Room at the White House.
