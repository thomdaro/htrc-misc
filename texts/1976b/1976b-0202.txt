Statement on Transmitting to the Congress an
Amendment to the Fiscal Year 1976 District
of Columbia Budget. April 16, 1976
IN ACCORDANCE with the District of Columbia Self-Government and Gov-
ernmental Reorganization Act of 1973 and the Budget and Accounting Act of
1921, I am transmitting an amendment to the fiscal year 1976 budget for the
District of Columbia. The amendment also includes provisions affecting the
transition quarter budget for the period July 1 through September 30, 1976.
This amendment includes a request from the District of Columbia govern-
ment to extend the interim U.S. Treasury borrowing authority of Section 723
of the Home Rule Act of 1973 to capital projects not approved under the pro-
visions of that act. The District government will shortly submit draft legislation
to authorize such additional borrowing.
I urge that the Congress favorably consider an increase of $3 million in the
Federal payment for the transition quarter, as authorized by Section 502 of the
Home Rule Act, as amended, in order to support the District's extraordinary
public safety needs during the Bicentennial summer 1976.

Memorandum to the Special Representative for Trade
Negotiations on Adjustment Assistance for the
Footwear Industry. April 19, 1976
[Dated April 16, 1976. Released April 19, 1976]
PURSUANT to Section 202(b)(1) of the Trade Act of 1974 (P.L. 93-618, 88
Stat. 1978), I have determined the actions I will take with respect to the report of
the United States International Trade Commission (USITC) dated February 20,
1976, concerning the results of its investigation of a petition for import relief filed
by the American Footwear Industries Association, the Boot and Shoe Workers
Union, and the United Shoe Workers of America.
I have determined that expedited adjustment assistance is the most effective
remedy for the injury suffered by the U.S. footwear industry and its employees.
I have determined that provision of import relief is not in the national economic
interest of the United States.
