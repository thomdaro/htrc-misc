Public Papers of the Presidents
tive government and the First Amendment rights of individual employees. It
has been successful, in my opinion, in striking that balance.
H.R. 8617 is bad law in other respects. The bill's provisions for the exercise
of a Congressional right of disapproval of executive agency regulations are Con-
stitutionally objectionable. In addition, it would shift the responsibility for
adjudicating Hatch Act violations from the Civil Service Commission to a new
Board composed of Federal employees. No convincing evidence exists to justify
this shift. However, the fundamental objection to this bill is that politicizing
the Civil Service is intolerable.
I, therefore, must veto the measure.

NOTE: The House of Representatives sustained the President's veto on April 29, 1976.
