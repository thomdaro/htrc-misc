Public Papers of the Presidents
recommended by Congressman Leggett of California. The tuna industry will
be ended, will be destroyed, if the full impact of Judge Richey's decision is car-
ried out.
And I've been very impressed with the innovative and the constructive new
nets that have been just shown to me. It is my understanding that the loss of
porpoises because of the new net is very substantially less than when the larger
nets that you saw a few minutes ago were used. I'm told there is even a smaller
net that is probably going to be in use.
So, the industry, the tuna industry, is seeking to correct the situation itself, and
I applaud them, and I think we ought to work with them so that we can save
the tuna industry. And, from what I am told, these new nets will also save the
porpoises. So, it is a plus for both sides, if the action is taken both within the
industry and by the Congress.
Q. What will you do specifically?
THE PRESIDENT. We will have spokesmen from my administration cooperate
with the Congress to try and pass the legislation that will take care of the judicial
decision.
Q. Mr. President, these are tuna fishermen who have had their vessels shot
at in the past. They have tried very vigorously to maintain the conservation regi-
men. Do you feel a sense of sympathy or compassion for what these men and
what this industry in this town has been through, and can you comment about
that?
THE PRESIDENT. I certainly have had long sympathy for and admiration for the
tuna industry and all the people involved in it.
Thank you all very, very much.
NOTE: The President spoke at 6-36 p.m. on board
the Theresa Janene, a tuna boat anchored in San
Diego Harbor. Prior to the exchange. he greeted
the crew and toured the boat
