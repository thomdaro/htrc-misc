through a wider grouping for the benefit of all.
Interdependence is a feature of the modern world,
a world that has become smaller, yet more complex.
Today, no nation can stand alone. We depend, as
never before, upon each other.
Mr. President, we live in times of uncertainty,
even of apprehension, and with forces that we can-

sight of our basic values, not underrate the worth
of what we know to be certain.
