Statement on Signing the Consumer Product Safety Commission
Improvements Act of 1976. May 12, 1976
THE CONSUMER Product Safety Commission was established in 1974 to
protect consumers from unreasonable risk of injury from the use of hazardous
products. Today, I have signed S. 644, a bill which will enable the Commission
to more effectively carry out this important mandate.
The Consumer Product Safety Commission Improvements Act of 1976 ex-
pands the Commission's authority by permitting the issuance of preliminary in-
junctions to prohibit distribution of products which present a substantial
hazard and by establishing new procedures and timetables within which con-
sumer safety standards must be promulgated.
Further, the act authorizes Federal preemption of State product safety laws
in certain enumerated circumstances. This will not only guarantee that con-
sumers have adequate protection but will free industry from the costly burden
of attempting to comply with a bewildering patchwork of State and local safety
standards.
If consumer product regulation is to have real meaning, adequate tools must
be provided the Commission responsible for protecting the American consumer.
The act I have signed provides such tools.
NOTE: As enacted, S. 644, approved May 11, 1976, is Public Law 94-284 (90 Stat. 503).
