Dear Mr. President:
Jews have greatly added to that diversity (B

national life. It is with this in mind that
Rosalynn and I extend our best wishes for

Dear Mr. President:
September 17, 1978
I have the honor to inform you that
during two weeks after my return home I
will submit a motion before Israel's
Parliament (the Knesset) to decide on the
following question:
If during the negotiations to conclude a
peace treaty between Israel and Egypt
all outstanding issues are agreed upon,
"are you in favor of the removal of the
Israeli settlers from the northern and
southern Sinai areas or are you in favor
of keeping the aforementioned settlers
in those areas?"
The vote, Mr. President, on this issue
will be completely free from the usual
Parliamentary Party discipline to the ef-
fect that although the coalition is being
now supported by 70 members out of 120,
every member of the Knesset, as I believe,
both on the Government and the Opposi-
tion benches will be enabled to vote in ac-
cordance with his own conscience.
Sincerely yours,
(signed)

I transmit herewith a copy of a letter
to me from Prime Minister Begin setting
forth how he proposes to present the issue
of the Sinai settlements to the Knesset for
the latter's decision.
In this connection, I understand from
your letter that Knesset approval to with-
draw all Israeli settlers from Sinai ac-
cording to a timetable within the period
specified for the implementation of the
peace treaty is a prerequisite to any nego-
tiations on a peace treaty between Egypt
and Israel.
Sincerely,
(signed)
JIMMY CARTER

the Arab Republic of Egypt, Cairo]

Dear Mr. President:
September 17, 1978
In connection with the "Framework for
a Settlement in Sinai" to be signed to-
night, I would like to reaffirm the position
of the Arab Republic of Egypt with re-
spect to the settlements:
1. All Israeli settlers must be with-
drawn from Sinai according to a
timetable within the period specified
for the implementation of the peace
treaty.
2. Agreement by the Israeli Govern-
ment and its constitutional institu-
tions to this basic principle is there-
fore a prerequisite to starting peace
negotiations for concluding a peace
treaty.
