Country Music Month,
October 1978
Message of the President. September 28, 1978
As modern American society becomes
more and more hectic and complex, there
is a desire in all of us to return to the
simple things in life.
This perhaps in part explains the grow-
ing popularityâ€”even in our busiest metro-
politan areas of country music. And des-
ignated
ignated as "Country Music Month,"
October invites us all to return, at least
vicariously, to the hills and the farms of
America and to retrace the everyday
emotions and experiences of country life.
Country music is part of the soul and
conscience of our democracy. It unfolds
the inherent goodness of our people and
of our way of life. It captures our in-
domitable spirit and pulsates with the sor-
rows, joys and unfailing perseverance of
ordinary men and women who sustain our
national vitality and strength.
I welcome the opportunity to applaud
the Country Music Association on its
sponsorship of this annual observance, and
I encourage more Americans to share in
the enjoyment and cultural enrichment
that country music can bring.
