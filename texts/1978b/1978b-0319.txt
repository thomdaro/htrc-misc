tional intelligence information.
The classified annex provides helpful
guidance. It differs, however, in some im-
portant respects from the views of the
Executive, and in light of some recent de-
velopments of mutual concern, I feel com-
pelled to seek some modifications in the
appropriations process. In any event, I
pledge that the executive agencies will
continue their cooperation with the in-
telligence oversight committees of Con-
gress, and I congratulate the House and
Senate for supporting these committees
in this difficult task.

Intelligence and Intelligence-
Related Activities Authorization
Act for Fiscal Year 1979
Statement on Signing H.R. 12240
Into Law. September 18, 1978
I am pleased to sign into law H.R.
12240, the Intelligence and Intelligence-
Related Activities Authorization Act for
Fiscal Year 1979. This is the first specific
annual authorization for appropriations
for intelligence functions of the Federal
Government.
This act symbolizes the recent achieve-
ments of the Congress that broaden and
intensify oversight of intelligence activities
through a cooperative effort with the ex-
ecutive agencies. I would like to express
particular commendation to the Perma-
nent Select Committee on Intelligence of
the House, the Select Committee on In-
telligence of the Senate, and the House
and Senate Armed Services Committees.
The process has, I believe, enhanced con-
gressional participation in oversight while
Days of Remembrance of
Victims of the Holocaust
Statement on Signing H.J. Res. 1014
Into Law. September 18, 1978
I have today signed House Joint Resolu-
tion 1014, designating April 28 and 29,
1979, as "Days of Remembrance of Vic-
tims of the Holocaust."
The systematic extermination of mil-
lions of human beings by the Nazis during
World War II was the most terrible crime
in all recorded history. In the words of
the resolution, the Holocaust remains "not
only a shocking symbol of Nazi brutality
and destruction, but also a symbol of the
danger inherent in tyranny, the pernicious
quality of bigotry, and the human capac-
ity to be cruel."
The resolution was passed unanimously
by both Houses of Congress. This reflects
our Nation's wholehearted conviction that
the lessons of the Holocaust must never
be forgotten.
