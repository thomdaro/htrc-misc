in the private sector.

ciation for the contributions you have

dedication to our fight
against inflation. I know I can count on
your continued support in this effort, as

ahead I may continue to seek your advice
and counsel. You have my warmest wishes

Dear Mr. President:
December 4, 1978
My experience over the last eight
months as your Assistant Special Coun-
selor on Inflation and Deputy to Ambas-
sador Strauss has been extremely reward-
ing and enjoyable. I want you to know
how much I appreciate your making this
opportunity possible.
As you have pointed out, inflation is
our nation's most crucial economic con-
cern. During the past several months, the
groundwork has been laid for a compre-
hensive and sustained attack on this crit-
ical problem. With the guidance of Bob
Strauss and your other economic policy
advisers, and now with the addition of
Alfred Kahn, I know that your program
is developing the broad support necessary
to insure success.
With this in mind, I am anxious to
return now to my work in the private
sector. You may rest assured, however,
that I will continue to support vigorously
and speak on behalf of the anti-inflation
program, as well as your other programs
which I endorse so enthusiastically.
The experience of working with you
and your fine staff has been a privilege I
will remember and treasure. Needless to
say, I will always be available to assist
you in any way possible.
With my deepest devotion and respect,
Sincerely,
S. LEE KLING
[The President, The White House, Washington,
D.C. 20500]
NOTE: On the same day, the White House
announced that the President will nominate
Mr. Kling to be a member of the Board of
Directors of the National Railroad Passenger
Corporation (AMTRAK).
