Administration of Jimmy Carter, 1978
Wild and Scenic River
Designation
Letter to the Speaker of the House and
the President of the Senate. October 13, 1978
Dear Mr. Speaker: (Dear Mr. President:)
In accordance with the Wild and
Scenic Rivers Act, I am pleased to trans-
mit a proposal to designate a 50.4-mile
segment of the Illinois River within the
Siskiyou National Forest in Oregon as an
element of the National Wild and Scenic
Rivers System.
This recommendation is based on a
careful study by the Secretary of Agricul-
ture and reflects the involvement of a
broad spectrum of concerned government
and private organizations at the national,
State and local levels. Designation of this
segment of the Illinois River will protect
its free-flowing character and preserve its
outstanding scenic and recreational val-
ues. It will also complement the adjoining
Rogue Wild and Scenic River.
I, therefore, strongly concur with the
Secretary's recommendation to preserve
the unique and irreplaceable natural
values of the Illinois River through its
designation as a Wild and Scenic River,
and I urge speedy Congressional approval.
Sincerely,
JIMMY CARTER
NOTE: This is the text of identical letters ad-
dressed to Thomas P. O'Neill, Jr., Speaker of
the House of Representatives, and Walter F.
Mondale, President of the Senate.
