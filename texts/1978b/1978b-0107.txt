Administration of Jimmy Carter, 1978
July 19
Citizenship Day and
Constitution Week, 1978
Proclamation 4579. July 19, 1978
By the President of the United States
of America
A Proclamation
September 17, 1978, will mark the 191st
anniversary of the signing, in Independ-
ence Hall, Philadelphia, of the Constitu-
tion of the United States. That great docu-
ment has endured, with but few changes,
as the finest foundation of government in
the history of mankind.
By a joint resolution of February 29,
1952, (36 U.S.C. 153), Congress desig-
nated September 17 as Citizenship Day, in
commemoration of the signing of the Con-
stitution and in recognition of all who,
by coming of age or by naturalization,
have attained the status of citizenship;
Congress also authorized the President to
issue annually a proclamation calling upon
officials of the Government to display the
flag on all Government buildings on that
day. By a joint resolution of August 2,
1956, (36 U.S.C. 159), Congress author-
ized the President to designate the period
beginning September 17 and ending Sep-
tember 23 of each year as Constitution
Week and to issue a proclamation calling
for the observance of that week.
Now, THEREFORE, I, JIMMY CARTER,
President of the United States of America,
call upon appropriate government officials
to display the flag of the United States
on all government buildings on Citizen-
ship Day, September 17, 1978, the 191st
anniversary of the signing of the Consti-
tution. I urge Federal, State and local of-
ficials, as well as leaders of civic, educa-
tional and religious organizations, to con-
duct suitable ceremonies and programs on
that day.
I also designate as Constitution Week
the period beginning September 17 and
ending September 23, 1978, and urge all
Americans to observe that week with cere-
monies and activities in their schools,
churches and in other suitable places in
order to foster a better understanding of
the Constitution and of the rights and
duties of United States citizens.
IN WITNESS WHEREOF, I have here-
unto set my hand this nineteenth day of
July in the year of our Lord nineteen
hundred seventy-eight, and of the Inde-
pendence of the United States the two
hundred and third.
JIMMY CARTER

Federal Civil Service
Reorganization
Statement on the House Government
Operations Committee's Action on
Reorganization Plan No. 2 of 1978.
July 19, 1978
I wish to express my appreciation for
the House Government Operations Com-
mittee's vote today on the civil service
reorganization plan. I especially want to
thank Committee Chairman Jack Brooks
for his leadership. The 31-0 committee
vote count reflects the strong bipartisan
support for my civil service reforms.
I look forward to the reorganization
plan's becoming effective, and to the pas-
sage by Congress of the companion civil
service legislation.
