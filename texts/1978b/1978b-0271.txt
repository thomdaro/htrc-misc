allow the Federal Government to set an
example for labor and industry and lead
the fight against inflation by example, and
not just words alone.
Accordingly, I strongly urge the Con-
gress to support the alternative recom-
mendation which is attached.

Executive Branch Administration
of the Privacy Act of 1974
Memorandum From the President.
August 31, 1978
Memorandum for the Heads of Execu-
tive Departments and Agencies
Enclosed for your information is a copy
of the Third Annual Report on executive
branch administration of the Privacy Act
of 1974, which I recently transmitted to
the Congress.
The protection of personal privacy is
of great concern to the American people,
and an important priority of my Adminis-
tration. I urge you to personally review
this report and take steps to further im-
prove your agency's administration of the
Privacy Act.
The report indicates that many agen-
cies have made substantial improvements
in their implementation of the Act. I urge
each of you, however, to initiate addi-
tional efforts during the coming year to
reduce the amount of personal informa-
tion collected and maintained by the Fed-
eral government, to avoid unwarranted
disclosure of this information, and to im-
prove the internal management of per-
sonal data systems.
I have asked the Director of the Office
of Management and Budget to monitor
these efforts and to keep me informed of
your progress.

leased on September 1.

flexibility subsequently made by the
Turkish side. In July there were further
encouraging signs. Both the Government
