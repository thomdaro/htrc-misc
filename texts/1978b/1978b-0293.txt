Administration of Jimmy Carter, 1978
Sept. 8
National School Lunch
Week, 1978
Proclamation 4594. September 8, 1978
By the President of the United States
of America
A Proclamation
Every child needs wholesome food. The
National School Lunch Program was
created in 1946 to help our nation achieve
that goal. It now provides nutritious
lunches to 26 million children every school
day.
I am proud of the success of the Na-
tional School Lunch Program and of the
two other nutrition-related school activi-
ties that complement its success.
One is the School Breakfast Program
that now serves 2.8 million children daily.
It gives all children, not just the needy,
the chance to eat breakfast at school if
they cannot eat at home.
The other is the Nutrition Education
and Training Program that will instruct
children, teachers, and school food service
workers on the relationship between food,
nutrition, and health.
In recognition of the National School
Lunch Program's contribution to Amer-
ica's youth, the Congress, by a joint res-
olution of October 9, 1962 (76 Stat. 779;
36 U.S.C. 168), has designated the week
beginning the second Sunday of October
of each year as National School Lunch
Week, and has requested the President to
issue annually a proclamation calling for
its appropriate observance.
Now, THEREFORE, I, JIMMY CARTER,
President of the United States of America,
do hereby urge the people of the United
States to observe the week of October 8,
1978, as National School Lunch Week
and to give special recognition to the
role of good nutrition in building a
stronger America through its youth.
IN WITNESS WHEREOF, I have here-
unto set my hand this eighth day of Sep-
tember, in the year of our Lord nineteen
hundred and seventy-eight, and of the
Independence of the United States of
America the two hundred and third.
JIMMY CARTER
