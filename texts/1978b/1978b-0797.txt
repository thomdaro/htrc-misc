Veto of Bill To Extend Certain
Nurse Training Programs
Memorandum of Disapproval of S. 2416.
November 10, 1978
MEMORANDUM OF DISAPPROVAL
I am withholding my approval from S.
2416, a bill that would extend a series of
programs authorizing special Federal
support for the training of nurses.
Although I support a number of its
provisions, this bill would continue sev-
eral Federal nurse training programs
whose objectives have been accomplished
and for which there is no longer a need.
Moreover, the funding authorizations are
excessive and unacceptable if we are to
reduce the budget deficit to help fight in-
flation.
For the past 22 years, the Federal gov-
ernment has provided substantial finan-
cial support for nursing education. From
1956 through 1977, almost $1.4 billion
was awarded for student traineeships,
loans, and scholarships; for construction
and basic support for nursing education
programs; and for projects to improve
nursing education and recruitment.
With the help of this support, the num-
ber of active nurses has more than dou-
bled since 1957 to over 1,000,000 in 1978.
Ten years ago, in 1968, there were 300
active nurses per 100,000 population in
the United States. By the beginning of
1977, this ratio had risen to 395 per
100,000 population.
The outlook is also good for adequate,
sustained growth in the supply of nurses.
There is, therefore, no reason for the gov-
ernment to provide special support to in-
crease the total supply of professional
nurses.
This year the Administration proposed
to extend only the authorities for special
projects in nursing education and for
nurse practitioner training programs, in
order to focus Federal nurse training sup-
port on areas of greatest national need.
This proposal was based on the concept
that future Federal assistance should be
limited to geographic and specialty areas
that need nurses most.
S. 2416 would authorize more than
$400 million for fiscal years 1979 and
1980, mostly for continued Federal fund-
ing of a number of unnecessary special
nurse training programs, at a potential
cost to the taxpayer far above my budget.
At a time of urgent need for budget re-
straint, we cannot tolerate spending for
any but truly essential purposes.
I must point out that nursing training
is primarily undergraduate education,
and nursing students are eligible for the
2007
