Administration of Jimmy Carter, 1978
Oct. 2
which requires the approval of con-
gressional committees before a user fee
system may be implemented by the Com-
mission. This "committee approval" re-
quirement is one of several types of
legislative veto devices which I and the
Attorney General view as unconstitution-
al, a position which I communicated to
the Congress on June 21, 1978.
Accordingly, I believe that the Com-
mission should treat this provision as a
requirement that it submit the proposed
fee plan to the appropriate committees,
but that regulations establishing the sys-
tem be promulgated as final unless the
Congress, within a reasonable period of
time, acts by legislation, subject to Presi-
dential approval or disapproval, to over-
turn such regulations.
NOTE: As enacted, S. 2391 is Public Law 95-
405, approved September 30.
10-4 Day
Statement by the President. October 2, 1978
This year marks the 20th anniversary
of Citizens Band radio. CB is now a widely
used emergency communications system.
It helps keep motorists safe on our Na-
tion's highways by providing faster noti-
fication of highway accidents, increased
detection of reckless driving, and more in-
formation to reduce traffic delays. The CB
is also effective in emergencies unrelated
to motor vehicles. By allowing for citi-
zens' participation in public safety, we
greatly enhance that safety.
The growth of CB use in recent years
is extraordinary. The Federal Communi-
cations Commission has now issued nearly
14 million licenses. More than 20 million
Americans have used a CB radio at one
time or another.
While CB is primarily for emergency
use, the nonemergency channels bring en-
joyment and companionship to millions of
Americans, including my own family.
In recognition of the fine service pro-
vided by Citizens Band radio, I join with
CB organizations across the country in
celebrating "10-4 Day," October 4, 1978.
