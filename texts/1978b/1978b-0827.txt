Proclamation 4608. November 15, 1978
TEMPORARY DUTY INCREASE ON THE IM-
PORTATION INTO THE UNITED STATES
OF CERTAIN HIGH-CARBON FERRO-
CHROMIUM
By the President of the United States
of America
A Proclamation
1. Pursuant to section 201 (d) (1) of
the Trade Act of 1974 (the Trade Act)
(19 U.S.C. 2251(d) (1)), the United
States International Trade Commission
(USITC) on September 5, 1978, re-
ported to the President (USITC Report
201-35) the results of its investigation
under section 201(b)(1) of the Trade
Act (19 U.S.C. 2251(b)(1)). The
USITC determined that ferrochromium,
containing over 3 percent by weight of
carbon, provided for in item 607.31 of
the Tariff Schedules of the United States
(TSUS) (19 U.S.C. 1202) is being im-
ported into the United States in such in-
creased quantities as to be a substantial
cause of serious injury to the domestic in-
dustry producing an article like or directly
competitive with the imported article. The
USITC recommended the imposition of
tariff increases on the column 1 rate of 30
percent ad valorem in the first year de-
clining to 20 percent ad valorem in the
fifth year of relief.
2. On November 2, 1978, pursuant to
section 202(b) (1) of the Trade Act (19
U.S.C. 2252(b)(1)), and after taking
into account the considerations specified
in section 202 (c) of the Trade Act (19
U.S.C. 2252 (c)), I determined to remedy
the injury found to exist by the USITC
through the proclamation of a temporary
duty increase different from that recom-
mended by the USITC. In accordance
with section 203 (b) (1) of the Trade Act
(19 U.S.C. 2253(b) (1)), I transmitted a
report to the Congress setting forth my
determination and intention to proclaim
a temporary duty increase and stating the
reasons why my decision differed from
the action recommended by the USITC.
3. Section 203 (e) (1) of the Trade Act
(19 U.S.C. 2253 (e) (1)) requires that
import relief be proclaimed and take ef-
fect within 15 days after the import re-
lief determination date.
4. Pursuant to section 203 (a) (1) of the
Trade Act (19 U.S.C. 2253(a)(1)), I
am providing import relief through the
temporary increase of import duty on fer-
rochromium, containing over 3 percent
by weight of carbon, valued less than 38
cents per pound, as hereinafter pro-
claimed.
NOW, THEREFORE, I, JIMMY CARTER,
President of the United States of Amer-
ica, acting under the authority vested in
me by the Constitution and the statutes of
the United States, including General
Headnote 4 of the TSUS (19 U.S.C.
1202), sections 203 and 604 of the Trade
Act (19 U.S.C. 2253 and 2483), and in
accordance with Articles I and XIX of
the General Agreement on Tariffs and
Trade (GATT) (61 Stat. (pt. 5) A 12
and 61 Stat. (pt. 5) A 58: 8 UST (pt. 2)
1786), do proclaim thatâ€”
(1) Part I of Schedule XX to the
GATT is modified to conform to the ac-
tions taken in the Annex to this procla-
mation.
(2) Subpart A, part 2 of the Appendix
to the TSUS is modified as set forth in the
Annex to this proclamation.
