Nov. 2
Administration of Jimmy Carter, 1978
Begin welcomed him there and exchanged and Tuesday, that each one of you will
visits.
But as you know, the peace talks broke
down, and I invited both men to come to
Camp David. They came, not because of
me, not because of my influence with
them, not because of my personal charac-
teristics, not even because I was President
of the United States, but they came be-
cause they realized that when I spoke to
them either publicly or in private, that I
did not speak with a hollow voice, that the
Mideast issues for the first time had been
openly debated. The American people
had been involved in the debate. The
Congress was part of a democratic team
committed to peace in the Middle East.
And they came trusting our Nation. We
had good luck at Camp David as a first
major step.
This morning I met with Prime Min-
ister Begin. Cy Vance, Secretary of State,
spent all day with him. Yesterday he was
with the Egyptians and the Israelis. And I
believe that our Nation's influence now,
our integrity, and our influence is strong
and sound and dependable enough so that
working with them-courageous lead-
ers-with your backing and involvement,
we can finally bring peace to the Mideast.
It's what I want.
And I want to ask you this question in
closing: Do you care enough about world
peace to invest part of your lifeâ€”at least
4 days of your life-in electing candidates
that you know will help and strengthen
me as I try to represent you well in inter-
national affairs, to keep our Nation
to keep our Nation
strong, firm, dynamic, trusted, and a ma-
jor element for peace? Will you do that
for me? [Applause] Very good.
It's good of you to come. It's good of
you to applaud.
I would like to ask you to do some-
thing specific that's very easy. I would like
for you to promise me that between now
contact at least 50 other people and get a
promise from them that they will go to
the polls Tuesday and vote-preferably
for the Democratic ticket, but at least
vote. Every one that will-think about
it awhile; don't lie to your own President.
[Laughter] But if you will promise to get
50 people to vote between now and Tues-
day, would you please stand? [Applause]
Thank you very much. You have made
my trip worthwhile.
Good luck. Thank you very much.
NOTE: The President spoke at 7:43 p.m. in the
Niles East High School gymnasium.
Earlier in the evening, the President at-
tended a fundraising reception for Represent-
ative Mikva at the Newton Minow residence.
Following his remarks at the rally, the Pres-
ident proceeded to the home of Mayor Michael
A. Bilandic of Chicago, where he spent the
night.
