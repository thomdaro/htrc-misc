Administration of Jimmy Carter, 1978
July 26
tried to carve out mutual principles for
agreement, even in the most general lan-
guage, know the difficulty of it. And his
language, which was adopted by the
United Nations, by all the disputing par-
ties, is still our guide in how to make
progress in the future.
At Helsinki, an agreement was signed
by, I believe, 34 nations, spelling out how
we might have more cooperation, more
exchange among nations who were poten-
tial adversaries, and the first international
commitment with specific bounds for the
honoring of the right of human beings to
emigrate from a country, to be part of the
united family, to have at least a modicum
of free speech. And the signatories of that
agreement at Helsinki were expected to
have their activities monitored.
At Belgrade this past year, there was
an international assembly to provide the
first assessment of compliance with the
Helsinki agreement, and Secretary Vance
and I were determined to have the best
possible leader there to represent our
country. He was a foremost spokesman
and established the principle, perma-
nently, I hope, that there is indeed an in-
ternational accountability for compliance
with human rights commitments that
were made at Helsinki.
There is no way nor need to outline the
numbers of special ad hoc commissions
and committees on which Arthur Gold-
berg has served our country, other Presi-
dents. But I look upon him as a man who
still has a long career ahead of him, but
already has exemplified in his personal
and public life principles committed to
basic human rights, to legal, diplomatic,
and political justice, sensitivity about the
needs of those who have been deprived of
the blessings of a modern society that
most of us enjoy, and a man whose own
personal principles have never deviated
from the highest possible standard, and
who has let those principles affect the at-
titude and the reputation of an entire
Nation, the Nation that we love so much.
I would like now to read the citation
for the Presidential Medal of Freedom.
[At this point, the President read the citation,
the text of which follows:]
THE PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES OF
