Airline Deregulation Legislation
Statement on House of Representatives Action
Approving the Legislation.
September 21, 1978
This is a welcome occasion. With this
legislation we achieve two critical national
objectives-controlling inflation and, at
the same time, cutting unnecessary bu-
reaucratic redtape.
When I announced support for airline
deregulation soon after taking office, the
bill had few friends. I am happy to say
that today it appears to have no enemies.
Industry has already benefited from it.
In the last few months, price competition
among domestic carriers in anticipation
of this bill has brought lower fares, more
passengers, and record profits.
Consumers are for it. Governors,
mayors, the National League of Cities,
small towns-all support airline deregu-
lation.
The House of Representatives deserves
congratulations for passing this important
1562
