Combined Federal Campaign
Memorandum From the President.
June 30, 1978
Memorandum for Federal Employees and
Military Personnel
Ours is a society in which individuals
traditionally share what they have with
others less fortunate than themselves. The
Combined Federal Campaign offers each
of us the opportunity to show our indi-
vidual concern for those in need of help.
This one campaign combines the fund-
raising efforts of the local United Way,
the American Red Cross, the National
Health Agencies, and the International
Services Agencies.
Through one gift to the Combined
Federal Campaign, we can help support
a wide variety of voluntary agencies.
These organizations support the sick, the
aged, the handicapped, the poverty-
stricken and the young-those who are
needy among us. Your contributions also
go towards research programs and our
friends in need across the seas. If you
choose, your gift can be made easier
through the use of payroll deductions.
While the decision to give and the
amount of one's gift are, of course, per-
sonal voluntary decisions, I hope that
each of you will join with me and other
federal workers, civilian and military, in
supporting your local Combined Federal
Campaign to the fullest extent possible.

Proclamation 4577. July 4, 1978
QUANTITATIVE LIMITATION ON THE
IMPORTATION OF CERTAIN MEAT
By the President of the United States
of America
A Proclamation
The Act of August 22, 1964 (78 Stat.
594; 19 U.S.C. 1202 note), provides for
the limitation of certain meat imports if
import estimates exceed 110 percent of
an adjusted base quantity for that year.
The limitation applies to fresh, chilled,
or frozen cattle meat and fresh, chilled,
or frozen meat of goats and sheep, except
lamb.
On December 30, 1977, the Secretary
of Agriculture determined (43 FR 987)
in accord with Section 2(b) (1) of the
Act that the adjusted base quantity of
meat for the calendar year 1978 is 1,183.9
million pounds. The Secretary now has
estimated (in the 1978 third quarterly
estimate) that the aggregate imports of
meat for 1978 will be 1,492.3 million
pounds. This estimate exceeds 110 per-
cent of the previously determined ad-
justed base quantity for 1978.
In accord with Section 2(c) of the Act,
the President must limit the import of
meat to the adjusted base quantity for
1978 of 1,183.9 million pounds, unless he
increases or suspends that limitation pur-
suant to Section 2(d) of the Act.
NOW, THEREFORE, I, JIMMY CARTER,
President of the United States of Amer-
ica, by the authority vested in me by Sec-
tion 2 of the Act, do hereby proclaim as
follows:
1. The total quantity of the articles
specified in item 106.10 (relating to fresh,
chilled, or frozen meat) and item 106.20
(relating to fresh, chilled, or frozen meat
1236
