me in this task-that we as partners

fail.
Thank you very much.

November 27, 1978
THE PRESIDENT. One of the most gratify-
ing things that has happened since I've
been in the White House as President has
been the evolution of a good, cooperative
partnership arrangement with
you. As
we've prepared major programs of all
kinds, involving health or education, in-
volving transportation, environmental
quality, we've tried to work very closely
with the officials who represent the cities
of our country. This has been especially
true as we evolved the urban policy that's
now the basis for programs that we are
implementing, either through Executive
action or through legislative processes. I
hope that this can continue, and I cer-
tainly expect it to continue.
My feeling is that you are at ease with
me and with my own administration, that
when we fail to measure up to your ex-
pectations, you let us know without de-
lay-[laughter]-and with at least a
proper amount of enthusiasm.
And when we are working in harmony,
as has almost always been the case, I've
appreciated your compliments and the
support that you've given our programs.
When I've been faced with major ques-
tions on international affairs, you've been
very supportive. And, of course, our do-
mestic programs, that don't directly affect
you as mayors, but affect you in a very
comprehensive way through your peopleâ€”
like energy-you've also been extremely
helpful. I want to be sure that this is a
part of our entire consciousness as a Na-
tion, that not only you and I realize it but
also those people who live in your cities,
who look to you as elected leaders, and,
of course, all of whom I represent as
President.
This morning I'll just be here for a few
minutes, and then officials of the Office of
Management and Budget-Bo Cutter, is
Bo Cutter here?-will go into some detail
about prospects for the 1980 fiscal year
budget. Many of the specific answers can't
be given yet. I'm just at this stage getting
a briefing from the Office of Management
and Budget about some of the issues that
will be presented to me later on. I haven't
made any decisions at this point. I've not
yet met with a single member of my Cabi-
net nor a single head of another major
agency to discuss their own desires for the
programs for 1980 fiscal year at all.
But as we go through this process dur-
ing the next few weeks, it's important to
us to know how you feel about the priori-
ties that we will address. And the main
purpose of the session this morning is to
let Bo Cutter and myself understand your
special concerns.
As I pointed out in my speech a few
minutes ago, all of us will have to suffer
