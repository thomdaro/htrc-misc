Remarks to Members of the Midcontinent
Farmers Association. August 14, 1978
Senator Talmadge, chairman of the Agri-
culture Committee and a true friend of
American farmers everywhere, and of con-
sumers as well; Senator Eagleton, who has
a very strategic position as chairman of
the Appropriations Subcommittee and
who watches over farmers throughout the
country as if they were his own children,
who does such a superb job; Senator Dan-
forth, a very courageous man who repre-

Ichord, who has welcomed me to his own
district; Congressman Burlison, who in

and me to Congressman Dick Bolling,

who had a tragedy in his family when his
fine wife, Jim, passed away; my good
friend, Governor Teasdale, and President
Fred Hinkle, who represents you well and
who's been a very fine counselor, for me
and for previous Presidents, who share
the responsibility that I have; and to the

is agriculture, and we've made good prog-
ress in this respect in the last year and a
half since I've been in office. The other
one is also of equal importance to farmers,
and that is inflation.
Sometimes it takes a great problem to
arouse someone to take strong action,
that's slow in coming. I tried to think of a
story to illustrate this point. The Sunday
before last my Sunday school teacher told
about a young man who went to work for
an insurance company, and his boss called
him in the first week and said, â€œIt's im-
