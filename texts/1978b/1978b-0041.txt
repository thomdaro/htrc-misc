A Proclamation
By a joint resolution approved July
17, 1959 (73 Stat. 212), the Eighty-Sixth
Congress authorized and requested the
President to proclaim the third week of
July in each year as Captive Nations
Week.
For more than two hundred years our
Nation has sustained the belief that na-
tional independence, liberty and justice
are the fundamental rights of all people.
Today we reaffirm our commitment to
these principles. In particular, we pay
tribute to those individuals and groups
who demonstrate their attachment to
these principles in their own country and
throughout the world.
Now, THEREFORE, I, JIMMY CARTER,
President of the United States of Amer-
ica, do hereby designate the week be-
ginning July 16, 1978, as Captive Nations
Week.
I invite the people of the United States
to observe this week with appropriate
ceremonies and activities and to renew
their dedication to the cause of all people
who seek freedom, independence, and
basic human rights.
IN WITNESS WHEREOF, I have here-
unto set my hand this eleventh day of
July, in the year of our Lord nineteen
hundred seventy-eight, and of the Inde-
pendence of the United States of America
the two hundred and third.
