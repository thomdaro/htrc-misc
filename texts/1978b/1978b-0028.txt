Administration of Jimmy Carter, 1978
port to the Congress on automotive fuel
economy. The highway safety document
describes developments in those aspects of
traffic safety in which Congress expressed
special interest in the Highway Safety Acts
of 1973 and 1976.
Since 1967, research has advanced the
state-of-the-art of traffic safety. Safety de-
vices have been perfected and incorpo-
rated in most automobiles on the road to-
day. Highways have been designed and
built with safety in mind, and traffic sys-
tems are better controlled. Even so, the
traffic safety problem remains serious. In
1977, 46,880 of our citizens died on the
nation's highways, and the number of in-
jured ran into the millions. The direct eco-
nomic cost is estimated at $43 billion an-
nually. Had there been no traffic safety
effort, and had the 1967 traffic fatality
rate held constant, the 1977 toll might
have been 77,000 dead and the direct eco-
nomic costs would have risen to $76 bil-
lion a year.
The fact remains that the fatality rate
(deaths per 100 million miles of travel)
has declined steadily since 1967, as the
various automotive and highway stand-
ards and programs have taken effect. The
drop was especially noticeable following
imposition, in January 1974, of the 55-
mph national maximum speed limit,
which has proven to be the single most
effective safety measure instituted in this
country. Cumulatively, the saving in lives
since 1967 exceeds 150,000.
Despite the advances that have been
made since 1967, motor vehicle accidents
have remained the sixth leading cause of
death in the United States. It is a national
calamity that the penalties fall dispropor-
tionately on the very young and on those
in their most productive years. In every
age bracket from 5 to 34 years, motor ve-
hicle accidents are either the leading or
the second cause of death; among the 15
to 19-year-olds, traffic fatalities claim 38
percent of total deaths.
Persistent obstacles remain to further
rapid or easy progress in reducing fatali-
ties. Average speeds are increasing gradu-
ally. Seat belts are a simple, effective
safety device, but are used by less than 20
percent of all motorists. The growing pop-
ularity of small cars, light trucks and vans
increases the weight disparity within the
vehicle mix and adversely affects the se-
verity of accidents. Alcohol continues to
be a contributing cause in half of all fatal
accidents. Rulemaking has focused pri-
marily on passenger cars, and many of the
standards have been found to be inappli-
cable to light trucks and vans. Some states
have repealed their motorcycle helmet
laws; some have reduced or eliminated
penalties for infractions of the 55-mph
speed limit.
Further progress in traffic safety is feas-
ible, but will require the dedication and
cooperation of Federal, State and local
governments, the automotive industry
and, above all, the motoring public whose
lives are at stake.
