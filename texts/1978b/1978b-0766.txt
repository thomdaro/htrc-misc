1â€“302. Executive Order 12084, of Sep-

ing respects:
(1) Section 1-202(d) is amended to
read as follows:
"(d) report to the Attorney General,
within the time specified in the notifica-
tion, the results of its activities, including
a list of persons whom the Commission
considers to be best qualified to fill the
vacancy.".
(2) Section 1-203 is amended to read
as follows:
I have today signed S. 2727, the Ama-
teur Sports Act of 1978.
The President's Commission on Olym-
pic Sports reported that the frequent dis-
putes between some of our amateur sports
organizations have hindered the grass-
roots development of amateur sports as
well as the performance of United States
athletes in international and Olympic
competition. This legislation, based on
the recommendations of the President's
Commission on Olympic Sports, estab-
lishes procedures and guidelines to resolve
disputes without placing the Federal
Government in control of amateur sports.
The act designates the United States
Olympic Committee as the coordinating
body for amateur sports, restructures the
Olympic Committee and many of its con-
stituent organizations, and gives the
Olympic Committee a mandate to resolve
disputes through arbitration.
I hope that this legislation will
strengthen United States participation in
international amateur sports competition
and broaden opportunities for all Ameri-
cans to enjoy amateur sports.
NOTE: As enacted, S. 2727 is Public Law 95-
606, approved November 8.
