National Hispanic Heritage
Week, 1978
Memorandum From the President.
August 17, 1978
Memorandum for the Heads of Execu-
tive Departments and Agencies
Subject: National Hispanic Heritage
Week
September 10 through 16 has been
designated National Hispanic Heritage
Week. A series of town meetings will be
held during this week in selected cities
throughout the country where there are
significant Hispanic population concen-
trations. The purpose of these meetings
will be to listen to the views of the His-
panic community on current economic
and social issues, particularly education,
jobs, housing, health and criminal justice.
Top level Hispanic appointees in each
of your agencies have been asked to par-
ticipate in these town meetings. I have
asked that they report to me on the views
expressed at the meetings and what kind
of action needs to be taken by the Depart-
ments and Agencies to deal with the
problems identified. I hope you will co-
operate in this effort by making available
to us the Hispanic appointees who have
been asked to participate in the week's
activities.

Heritage Week should not be underesti-
