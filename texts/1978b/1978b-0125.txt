PRESIDENTIAL DOCUMENTS
Week Ending Friday, July 28, 1978
Equality for Women
Memorandum From the President.
July 20, 1978
Memorandum for the Heads of Depart-
ments and Agencies
Women represent more than half of the
population of this country, but still do not
enjoy the specific protection of the United
States Constitution. They continue to face
discrimination and unequal treatment in
many spheres of human activity.
I have made clear before that ratifica-
tion of the Equal Rights Amendment is
and will remain a priority with this Ad-
ministration. In addition, I am deter-
mined that every resource of the Federal
government be applied to eliminating dis-
crimination and inequality based on sex.
This Administration has made impor-
tant gains, particularly in increasing the
participation of women in Federal gov-
ernment. However, I am convinced of the
need to increase our effort to achieve
equal treatment for women throughout
the Nation.
In response to this need, I have asked
my Assistant, Midge Costanza, to focus
her efforts on women's issues with partic-
ular emphasis on the Equal Rights
Amendment and implementation of the
International Women's Year Plan of Ac-
tion. As my Assistant she will be expected
to:
-participate in the development of all
domestic policy decisions of this Ad-
ministration which affect women;
-assure that I am fully advised of the
impact on women of policy decisions,
legislation and Federal programs;
-coordinate the Interdepartmental
Task Force on women, established
by Section 6 of Executive Order
12050;
-provide liaison and support for the
National Advisory Committee for
Women established by Executive Or-
der 12050;
-monitor and provide frequent and
regular reports to me on our progress
in eliminating unequal treatment of
women.
I am further directing that the head of
each department and agency take the fol-
lowing actions:
-make the most of public appearance
opportunities to demonstrate the Ad-
ministration's commitment to the
Equal Rights Amendment;
