Administration of Jimmy Carter, 1978
Aug. 24
THE PRESIDENT. Well, I'll say Amy's
spent probably 10 nights in a sleeping bag,
since I've been President. It's probably
been 3 years since I've been in a sleeping
bag.
Q. Since a scoutmaster?
THE PRESIDENT. Oh, even since then.
When I was Governor, we went out every
now and then.
Q. Can you swim?
THE PRESIDENT. Oh, yes, very well.
[Laughter]
THE PRESIDENT. I thought everybody
did. We went swimming last night.
Q. But you didn't-
-
THE PRESIDENT. By accident, no.
Q. You didn't stay in long, did you?
THE PRESIDENT. I stayed in a good
while.
Q. Bradley stayed in 17 seconds.
[Laughter]
Q. Have you missed what has been
going on in the world?
THE PRESIDENT. I talked to the Vice
President on the phone this afternoon, got
Thank you. Good to see you all; really a report on several things. [Inaudible] I
proud to be here.
NOTE: The exchange began at 6:05 p.m.

Conclusion of the President's Raft Trip.
August 24, 1978
THE PRESIDENT. The best 3 days I have
ever had. It really was great.
Q. What were the high points, Mr.
President?
THE PRESIDENT. We saw mountain
sheep a part of the time. We saw a golden
eagle, saw a lot of—[inaudible]—and
caught a lot of fish. We had a contest
today. And I got 59 trout. We came in a
little ahead of the others. The scenery
was just-
Q. Did you get hung up on any rapids
at all during the 2 days?
THE PRESIDENT. No. We had a little
trouble on one waterfall.
Q. That was Tappen Falls. We were
there.
THE PRESIDENT. I thought maybe they
changed the name by now. [Laughter]
Q. Did you go in the water at all?
THE PRESIDENT. I went swimming.
Q. Didn't you?
have gotten a Presidential briefing every
morning at 7 o'clock from the State De-
partment and also from the CIA. So, we
had good radio communications from the
outside world. Everything seems to be
quiet.
Q. Did the Interior Secretary lobby you
at all on the wilderness issue up the river?
THE PRESIDENT. Well, he gave me a lot
of information about it. But we will have
to discuss it very carefully. I think one of
the best things about this region is that
right through the part we went, it ought
to be preserved and not destroyed. But
back off from the river, where we saw fly-
ing in from the plane, were very good
productive timber regions where we ought
to harvest timber and let the country
benefit from it. So, I like a good balance
between preserving the natural beauty,
unchanged, on the one hand, and harvest-
ing growing timber in appropriate areas,
which is what he is working on, and I
agree with him.
Q. Are you satisfied, Mr. President, that
your self-proclaimed moratorium
world crises held up?
on
THE PRESIDENT. So far, it has.
Q. Is it calmer now in Nicaragua?
What do you hear?
THE PRESIDENT. I have gotten reports
from several countries around the world.
I won't go into that now.
