Administration of Jimmy Carter, 1978
Nov. 1
The expanded commitments to educa-
tion represented by these two bills fully
support the assertion that this has been
the most education-minded Congress
since the midsixties. This year with the
help of education and parent associations,
we have together taken an historic step
in the evolution of the Federal role in
education.
The Nation is deeply indebted to the
work of the members of the Senate Hu-
man Resources Committee-Education
Subcommittee and the House Education
and Labor Committee-Education sub-
committees. In particular, I wish to ex-
tend my personal thank you to Senators
Williams and Pell, Congressmen Perkins
and Ford, and to Secretary Califano,
Assistant Secretary Mary Berry, and
Commissioner of Education Ernest Boyer
for the bills I am signing today.
NOTE: As enacted, H.R. 15, the Education
Amendments of 1978, is Public Law 95-561,
and S. 2539, the Middle Income Student As-
sistance Act, is Public Law 95-566, both ap-
proved November 1.
