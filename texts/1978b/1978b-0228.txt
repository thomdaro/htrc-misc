During the past year, I appointed a
new Chairman and two Board members.
To represent the public interest and ad-
vise the Congress of the Administration's
position, I appointed as Chairman, Wil-
liam P. Adams, former Transportation
Counsel for the House Committee on In-
terstate and Foreign Commerce. I ap-
pointed one Board member who was
nominated by railroad managementâ€”
Earl Oliver, a former official of the Illi-
nois Central Gulf Railroad and the Na-
tional Railway Labor Conference-and
another Board member who was nomi-
nated by railroad labor-Charles J.
Chamberlain, former President of the
Brotherhood of Railroad Signalmen and
Chairman of the Railway Labor Exec-
utives' Association. Each of these ap-
pointees is extremely well qualified and
can be expected to set a high level of
public service.
