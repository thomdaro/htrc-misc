Administration of Jimmy Carter, 1978
President Houari Boumediene
of Algeria
Statement on the Death of the Algerian
President. December 27, 1978
It is with deep regret that I have
learned of the death of His Excellency
Houari Boumediene, President of the Al-
gerian Democratic and Popular Republic
and President of the Council of the Rev-
olution. President Boumediene played an
outstanding role in Algeria's long struggle
for independence. His devotion to duty
and his contributions as an international
statesman are well known. But it is for his
efforts to help create and strengthen an
independent, self-sufficient Algerian na-
tion that he will be most remembered.
Rosalynn and I extend our condolences
to President Boumediene's family and to
the Algerian people, who have lost
a leader whom the world will long re-
member.

leased by the White House Press Office on De-
