BEAVER CASTLE GIRL SCOUTS
Q. Hi, Mr. President.
THE PRESIDENT. Good afternoon.
Q. Welcome to the greatest county in
Pennsylvania-Beaver. I'm Eleanor Vav
ro from Patterson Township. Beaver
Falls, Joe Namath's town. Tell Lillian.
THE PRESIDENT. I'll tell her.
Q. Mr. President, I will leave all the
about those that already have jobs and big questions to all the people. I know
focus more and more of their attention on
those that still don't have jobs. We have
had a substantial reduction, by the way, in
unemployment among young black citi-
zens. But we've got a long way to
to go.
And
I believe that with the help of the private
sector that we can increase this employ-
ment opportunity even more.
But we've recognized, obviously, this to
be our most serious unemployment prob-
lem. It's the one that has responded less to
our programs so far. But it will be the top
focus of our attention in the months
ahead.
Thank you, Mr. Henderson.

big hug? [Laughter]
THE PRESIDENT. Well, the answer to
one of those questions is absolutely yes.
[Laughter] And the answer to the other
one is that I'll have to ask Rosalynn
about both of them. [Laughter] This was
not on the program. [Laughter]
I would like to ask all of you not to
tell my wife about this until I can get
home and explain it. [Laughter] Miss
Babiak, that's the nicest question I've had
so far.
there's many, many large ones. But my
question is a very simple one. I will talk
about something that I know something
about.
President of the United States to honor
How would you like to be the first
us by being a member of the Beaver
Castle Girl Scouts? [Laughter]

Q. I'll help you out, Mr. President.
THE PRESIDENT. I wasn't a Boy Scout,
because I lived too far back in the coun-

got a little bit older.
