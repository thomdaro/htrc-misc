Fishery Conservation
and Management Bill
Statement on Signing H.R. 10732 Into Law.
August 29, 1978
Yesterday I signed H.R. 10732, which
amends the Fishery Conservation and
Management Act of 1976. This bill au-
thorizes fiscal year 1979 appropriations to
implement the act, which first established
the 200-mile Fishery Conservation Zone
off the coast of the United States.
This bill also establishes a permit sys-
tem for foreign fish processing vessels
within the 200-mile limit. Under this sys-
tem, Government permits would be
granted to foreign fish processors to pur-
chase fish caught by U.S. fishermen with-
in the 200-mile zone only if domestic proc-
essors do not have the capacity or intent
to process these fish. To date, domestic
processors have not purchased such fish
as hake and pollack, which have no do-
mestic market. Foreign processors, how-
ever, have become interested in these fish
because of clear foreign demand.
My administration is strongly commit-
ted to reducing barriers to international
trade. While I am concerned that the
establishment of this permit system may be
viewed by some foreign nations as an in-
terference with international commerce,
the most egregious provisions have been
removed at our request. Thus, during the
legislative process, the administration
made clear our objections to a provision
which would have denied permits to proc-
essors from countries with import barriers
to U.S. fish and fish products. That pro-
vision would have conflicted directly with
our trade policies. I am pleased that this
provision was deleted by Congress.
When Congress was considering this
bill, we made clear our preference for a
permit system lasting only for 2 years,
rather than permanently. However, I be-
lieve that this bill will in practice cause
little if any adverse impact on foreign fish
processors, since most of the interest by
foreign processors relates to fish species
not currently consumed in the United
States products.
At the same time, this bill will provide
domestic processors with increased cer-
tainty about fish supplies, which will in
turn provide an incentive for investments
in increased capacity. It also will provide
American fish processors with comparable
