would not be in the national economic
interest. The measure proposed by the
USITC (removal of these products from
the GSP program thereby raising the
tariff on imports from countries eligible
for GSP benefits to 12.5%) would not
provide relief in view of the large price
differences between imports and the do-
mestically produced items and further-
more it would contribute to inflation. In
addition, imports have shown little sig-
nificant increase during the five years
examined, while import prices were re-
duced 30 percent and domestic prices
nearly doubled.
This determination is to be published in
the FEDERAL REGISTER.

Peace Corps
Statement on the Resignation of Carolyn R.
Payton as Director. November 24, 1978
I have come to the conclusion that
there are unresolvable policy differences
between the Director of ACTION, Sam
Brown, and the Director of one of its
major agencies, the Peace Corps, Dr.
Carolyn Payton. In order to carry out
the important programs of ACTION
and to resolve this serious impasse, I am
today accepting the resignation of Dr.
Payton as Director of the Peace Corps.
This does not in any way reflect on
the competence, integrity, or sincerity of
Dr. Payton. I wish to express my appre-
ciation to her for the good service which
she has rendered.
