A Proclamation
The Kobuk Valley and its environs, an
area located in the northwest interior of
Alaska, contains important archeological
data and biological and geological fea-
tures of great scientific significance.
Archeological features within the area
illustrate an unbroken continuum of hu-
man adaptation to the natural environ-
ment from the early pre-Eskimo people
of 10,500 years ago to present-day local
residents. Scientists recently discovered
more than 100 dwellings occupied in
about 1250 A.D., comprising the largest
settlement of its kind. The Onion Portage
Archeological District is located within
the area, and is listed on the National
Register of Historic Places. Archeological
research at Onion Portage has yielded
evidence of more than 10,000 years of
human occupation.
The area contains the Great and Little
Kobuk Sand Dunes, which lie north of
the Arctic Circle and include both active
and stabilized dunes. Scientific studies of
the dunes show them to be older than
33,000 years, and several plants have been
found in association with the dunes en-
vironment which are scientifically un-
usual in the area. The Great Kobuk Sand
Dunes attain a height of 100 feet.
The inclusion of the watersheds on the
north and south of the Kobuk River pro-
tects a uniquely representative series of
interrelated plant communities. There is
