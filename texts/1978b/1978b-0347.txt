Administration of Jimmy Carter, 1978
Sept. 20
To facilitate congressional delibera-
tions, I have asked that the Attorney Gen-
eral and the Secretary of the Interior
offer their advice and technical assistance
to the committees that review the docu-
ment.
The White House,
September 20, 1978.
JIMMY CARTER
ATTACHMENT
1. Under the constitution, the aggre-
gate public debt limitation for the Virgin
Islands Government may not exceed two
and one-half times its average annual
revenue for the previous three fiscal years
(exclusive of Federal grants). But because
the constitution does not adequately de-
fine "revenue," the exact level of the new
debt limitation is unclear and could con-
ceivably be a substantial increase over the
current level, depending on which receipts
from various Virgin Island governmental
accounts are counted as revenue. There-
fore, the definition of revenue in determin-
ing the public debt limitation under the
constitution should be clarified. The
pres-
ent debt limitation, authorized by the or-
ganic act and subsequent legislation, is
primarily based on a percentage of as-
sesed property valuation in the Virgin
Islands.
2. The constitution also creates the
position of Territorial Comptroller Gen-
eral, who would be responsible for au-
diting all revenues, expenditures, and
programs of the local government. The
relationship of the proposed Comptroller
General with the current Federal Comp-
troller for the Virgin Islands should be
clarified. Because major Federal assist-
ance is received by the Virgin Islands, the
proposed Comptroller General should
complement, but not substitute for, the
Federal Comptroller.
3. Section 3 of the transitional schedule
of the constitution provides that, after the
effective date of the constitution, â€œlaws,
executive orders, and regulations that are
inconsistent with the constitution shall be
void to the extent of the inconsistency."
The Department of Justice advises me
that section 3 cannot apply to the sources
of law based on Federal authority, such as
Federal statutes, executive orders, and
regulations--including executive orders
and regulations issued by the territorial-
appointed governors. The Department,
however, recommends revising in the sec-
tion to remove any uncertainty about the
applicability of Federal law.
