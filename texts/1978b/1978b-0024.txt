July 1
Administration of Jimmy Carter, 1978
Federal-State Cooperative
Forestry Programs
Statement on Signing H.R. 11777, H.R. 11778,
and H.R. 11779 Into Law. July 1, 1978
I have approved the enrolled bills H.R.
11777, H.R. 11778, and H.R. 11779, pro-
viding for updated and broadened pro-
grams in cooperative forestry, forestry re-
search, and forestry extension education.
The three acts were developed through
the cooperative efforts of State forestry
agencies, State extension services, forest
industries, conservation organizations, for-
estry schools, and Members of Congress
working with the Department of Agricul-
ture. The American Forestry Association.
through its sponsorship of an "areas of
agreement" committee achieved agree-
ment among diverse interests on key pro-
visions. I recognize that the acts repre-
sent a consensus within the forestry com-
munity.
H.R. 11777 provides for technical as-
sistance, cost-sharing, and resource protec-
tion programs for non-Federal forest
lands, to be carried out through coopera-
tive arrangements with State forestry
agencies. It consolidates nine different
programs in seven authorities into a sin-
gle authority. It includes a provision al-
lowing Federal cooperative forestry funds
to be consolidated, so that each State will
have more flexibility in targeting forestry
programs to the specific needs and prior-
ities of the States. I expect the Secretary
of Agriculture to coordinate rural fire ac-
tivities conducted under this act with the
Secretary of Commerce, who has overall
responsibility for general fire prevention
and control activities.
H.R. 11778 modernizes and expands
the 50-year-old forestry research program,
providing more specific authority to meet
current and future research needs. The
bill provides an appropriate link to other
agricultural research programs authorized
by Title XIV of the Food and Agriculture
Act of 1977.
H.R. 11779 expands the renewable re-
sources extension program in cooperation
with State Extension Services to provide
private forest landowners with education
and information about managing and us-
ing forests, rangeland, fish and wildlife,
water, and other renewable resources.
These bills do contain more features
which we have objected to previouslyâ€”
the urban forestry assistance program, the
establishment of a separate rural fire
emergency disaster fund, and a separate
appropriation for forestry extension.
While I maintain my previous position on
these issues, I do not believe their pres-
ence in these otherwise worthwhile acts
justifies my disapproval of the acts.
I have approved these three bills be-
cause they provide the necessary means for
the Federal and State Governments and
universities to cooperatively aid forest
landowners and others. The bills are com-
patible with the policy and direction con-
tained in my May 23, 1977, environmen-
tal message.
NOTE: As enacted, H.R. 11778 and H.R.
11779 are Public Laws 95-307 and 95-306, re-
spectively, approved June 30, and H.R. 11777
is Public Law 95-313, approved July 1.

This act provides congressional author-
ization to bring into effect the 1978 In-
