Alaska, Inc., and certain individuals rep-
resented by the Air Line Pilots Associa-
tion, a labor organization.

rected that the provisions of Section 10
of the Railway Labor Act, as amended, be

the dispute in its judgment substantially
threatens to interrupt interstate com-
merce to a degree such as to deprive a
section of the country of essential trans-
portation service.

vested in me by Section 44 of the Airline
