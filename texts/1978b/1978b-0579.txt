Administration of Jimmy Carter, 1978
Oct. 18
We thank you for those fine words.
When the mayor of Atlanta, Maynard
Jackson, was inaugurated, I was Gover-
nor. And I went to a beautiful inaugura-
tion ceremony; with two exceptions, the
best one I've ever been to. [Laughter]
The entire group of thousands of
people were thrilled by the beautiful
voice of Mattiwilda Dobbs, who is an
aunt of Maynard Jackson, the mayor of
Atlanta, and a native of my own State.
I think that those of you who have seen
the back side of this medal, perhaps when
it fell on the floor, can see a world being
held in God's hands. And we have now,
to close our ceremony, Mattiwilda Dobbs,
who will sing, â€œHe's Got the Whole World
in His Hands."
