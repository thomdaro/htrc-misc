land, labor and capital is essential if this
country is to have a continuing and ade-

To achieve a better mutual understand-

President of the United States of Amer-

vember 17 through November 23, 1978,
as National Farm-City Week.
IN WITNESS WHEREOF, I have here-
unto set my hand this twenty-seventh day
of September, in the year of our Lord
nineteen hundred seventy-eight, and of
the Independence of the United States of
America the two hundred and third.
