industry producing clothespins provided
for in items 790.05, 790.07 and 790.08 of
the Tariff Schedules of the United States.
After considering all relevant aspects of
the case, including those considerations
set forth in section 202 (c) of the Trade
Act of 1974, I have determined that pro-
vision of import relief is not in the na-
tional economic interest.
The imposition of import relief would
not be an effective means to promote ad-
justment in the domestic industry. While
imports from the PRC have become an in-
creasingly important component of U.S.
imports, other sources still accounted for
seventy-three percent of U.S. imports in
1977. Foreign sources, other than the
PRC, are able to supply clothespins to the
U.S. market at prices significantly below
the prices charged by U.S. producers.
Moreover, existing foreign capacity would
Message to the Congress. October 2, 1978
To the Congress of the United States:
In accordance with the Impoundment
Control Act of 1974, I herewith report 30
deferrals of fiscal year 1979 funds totalling
$1,178.2 million. The deferrals are pri-
marily routine in nature and do not, in
most cases, affect program levels.
The details of each deferral are con-
tained in the attached reports.

not be a limitation on foreign producer Ceramic Tableware Imports
ability to increase shipments to the U.S.
Thus, third country suppliers would likely
fill any excess U.S. demand resulting from
a limitation of any kind on imports of
clothespins from the PRC.
In addition, it should be noted that the
USITC has instituted an investigation un-
der section 201 of the Trade Act of 1974
to determine whether clothespins from all
foreign suppliers are being imported into
the United States in such quantities as to
be a substantial cause of serious injury, or
threat thereof, to the domestic industry.
A determination on this case by the
USITC is due by November 21, 1978. The
import problems facing the domestic
clothespin industry will be considered fur-
ther within the context of this pending
escape clause case.
This determination is to be published
in the FEDERAL REGISTER.
