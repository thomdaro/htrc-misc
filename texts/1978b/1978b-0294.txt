extension for one year of the authorities
currently exercised under Section 5(b) of
the Trading with the Enemy Act, 50
U.S.C. App. 5(b), with respect to the

prohibit importation or dealing in mer-
chandise of these countries or transactions
in blocked assets of these countries or their
nationals absent a license from the Office
of Foreign Assets Control, Department of
