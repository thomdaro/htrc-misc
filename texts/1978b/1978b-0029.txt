Administration of Jimmy Carter, 1978
Fighting in Beirut, Lebanon
Statement by the President. July 6, 1978
I wish today to express my deep con-
cern at the continued bloodshed that has
accompanied the fighting in Beirut over
recent days. Despite appeals by Secretary
General Waldheim and His Holiness the
Pope to which the United States has
added its voice and numerous efforts to
achieve a cease-fire, the clashes unfortu-
nately continue with heavy casualties
among the innocent civilian population.
The fighting in Beirut is in no one's in-
terest. It adds to the hatred and suffering
accumulated over several years of tragedy
in Lebanon and delays the efforts of the
Lebanese Government, with the help and
support of friendly governments, to re-
build national institutions and ensure se-
curity for all Lebanese.
I therefore join with those world lead-
ers calling for an immediate end to the
fighting and urge all parties with influ-
ence over the situation to spare no effort
to set Lebanon once more on the road to
peace and progress.
