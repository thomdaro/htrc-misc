Purchasing water projects on the in-
stallment plan does not reduce their cost
to American taxpayers. Nor does it jus-
tify funding projects which fail to meet
reasonable standards. We can achieve an
efficient Budget only if we are prepared
to admit the true costs of the actions we
take.
No challenge the Congress and the Ex-
ecutive Branch must face together is
more painful than the exercise of
budgetary discipline in each individual
case. But only consistent, determined dis-
cipline will enable us to achieve our
shared objectives of controlling inflation,
balancing the budget and making gov-
ernment more efficient. The action I am
taking today is part of that effort.
This appropriations bill is a true and
difficult test of our resolve to discipline
the Federal budget. Each bit of addi-
tional spending always looks small and
unimportant against the total Federal
budget. The temptation to look the other
way
in each case is always great. But both
Congress and the Executive Branch must
recognize that there is no one single dra-
matic act which will control the budget.
Budgetary control must be achieved by
the cumulative impact of hard choices
such as the one I am presenting to the
Congress today.
Following are my specific objections
to this bill:
-Funding is reinstated in this bill for
unsound water projects. Six projects not
funded last year by the Congress after
thorough review determined them to be
unwise investments would receive fund-
ing this year. The six projects would cost
more than $580 million to complete.
Three of these would be funded for con-
struction and three for further study,
even though no additional analysis is
needed to augment the exhaustive infor-
mation now available. One of the proj-
ects funded for further study would re-
quire an investment of over $1 million
per farm family served. The majority of
*Includes three projects funded for construc-
tion (total cost: $302 million) and three proj-
ects funded for further study (total cost: $284
million).
