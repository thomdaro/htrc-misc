October 23, 1978
The American people place inflation
at the top of the list of things about which
they are concerned. One of the major
factors fueling inflation is the slowdown
in productivity growth in our country.
Productivity per person-hour has de-
creased from a 3.2 percent annual growth
rate to 1.6 percent in recent years. This
also has a very adverse effect as we com-
pete with other nations whose productiv-
ity growth has been much higher.
Improvement in the growth of produc-
tivity is essential, therefore, to the social
and economic welfare of the American
people. This improvement can be realized
if the public and private sectors work to-
gether to make the best possible use of
technology, capital, and human resources.
The Federal Government can make
major contributions in improving the
utilization of these resources.
