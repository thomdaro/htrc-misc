Theatrical Troupe. July 20, 1978
It's a great pleasure for me as President
of our country to welcome to the United
States such distinguished artists and per-
formers from the People's Republic of
China.
You represent a great nation. I know

neapolis and to Los Angeles and to San
Francisco, and we are glad that you have
an opportunity to see our great Nation.
We have an opportunity to observe

who see your performances themselves,
but through television, millions of Amer-
icans will have an opportunity to have
their lives blessed by the observance of
your artistry.
