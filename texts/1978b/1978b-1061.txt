White House Statement on the
Organization's Increase in Oil Prices.
December 17, 1978
We regret the OPEC decision and
hope that it will be reconsidered before
the next steps take effect.
Market conditions do not warrant a
price increase of this magnitude, since the
current tightness in the world oil market
is a temporary situation that does not re-
flect underlying demand forces.
This large price hike will impede pro-
grams to maintain world economic re-
covery and to reduce inflation. Responsi-
bility for the success of these programs is
shared by the oil-producing countries.
NOTE: Earlier, representatives of the member
countries meeting in Abu Dhabi, United Arab
Emirates, had voted to increase oil prices at
3-month intervals to a total of 14.5 percent by
the end of 1979.
Imports of Papermaking
Machinery From Finland
Proclamation 4630. December 15, 1978
REDUCTION OF RATES OF DUTY ON
CERTAIN PAPERMAKING MACHINERY
By the President of the United States
of America
A Proclamation
Under the Geneva (1967) Protocol to
the General Agreement on Tariffs and
Trade (GATT), the United States
agreed to staged reductions in duty rates
on machines for making cellulosic pulp,
paper, or paperboard, and parts thereof
provided for in items 668.00 and 668.06
of the Tariff Schedules of the United
States (TSUS) (19 U.S.C. 1202).
On December 16, 1967, the President
modified (in Proclamation No. 3822) the
TSUS in order to carry out the Geneva
Protocol including staged reductions of
column 1 duty rates to 3.5 percent ad val-
orem on machines for making cellulosic
pulp, paper, or paperboard, and parts
thereof.
The Republic of Finland has bene-
fitted from those tariff reductions. As a
result of a March 13, 1978 ruling by the
United States Customs Service the bene-
fits contemplated to accrue to the Repub-
lic of Finland from these tariff reductions
were substantially reduced.
The restoration of the contemplated
benefits of these tariff reductions to the
Republic of Finland would promote the
foreign trade of the United States and
the Republic of Finland. Pursuant to Sec-
tion 101 (a) of the Trade Act of 1974
(the Trade Act) (19 U.S.C. 2111(a)),
I have determined that certain existing
duties of the United States are unduly
burdening and restricting the foreign
trade of the United States and that one or
more purposes of the Trade Act would be
promoted by entering into a trade agree-
ment with the Republic of Finland and
restoring those contemplated benefits.
Having complied with the provisions
of the Trade Act, including Sections 131
(a), 132, and 133, I have, through my
2271
