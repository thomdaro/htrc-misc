Administration of Jimmy Carter, 1978
Dec. 1
mation 4466 of October 4, 1976, and
Proclamation 4539 of November 11, 1977.
2. The President took these actions
pursuant to authority vested in him by the
Constitution and statutes of the United
States, including section 201 (a) (2) of the
Trade Expansion Act of 1962 (19 U.S.C.
1821(a)(2)), and in conformity with
Headnote 2 of Subpart A of Part 10 of
Schedule 1 of the TSUS, hereinafter re-
ferred to as the "Headnote." The Head-
note was part of a trade agreement which
embodied the results of the "Kennedy
Round" of international trade negotia-
tions. That agreement is known formally
as the 1967 Geneva Protocol to the Gen-
eral Agreement on Tariffs and Trade, and
the agreement includes, as an Annex,
"Schedule XX," a schedule of United
States trade concessions made during
those negotiations. This agreement was
concluded pursuant to section 201(a) of
the Trade Expansion Act of 1962 (19
U.S.C. 1821(a)), and was implemented
by Proclamation No. 3822, of December
16, 1967 (82 Stat. 1455) which, inter alia,
added the Headnote to the TSUS.
3. The Headnote provides, in relevant
part, as follows:
"(i) . . . if the President finds that a
particular rate not lower than such Janu-
ary 1, 1968, rate, limited by a particular
quota, may be established for any articles
provided for in item 155.20 or 155.30,
which will give due consideration to the
interests in the United States sugar
market of domestic producers and ma-
terially affected contracting parties to the
General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade,
he shall proclaim such particular rate and
such quota limitation, .
â€œ(ii) . . . any rate and quota limitation
so established shall be modified if the
President finds and proclaims that such
modification is required or appropriate to
give effect to the above considera-
tions; . . ."
4. Section 201 (a) (2) of the Trade Ex-
pansion Act authorizes the President to
proclaim the modification or continuance
of any existing duty or other import re-
strictions, or such additional import re-
strictions as he determines to be required
or appropriate to carry out any trade
agreement entered into under the author-
ity of that Act, except that pursuant to
section 201(b) (2) of the Act, the Presi-
dent may not by proclamation increase a
rate of duty to a rate more than 50 per-
cent above the rate existing on July 1,
1934.
5. I find that the modifications herein-
after proclaimed of the quota applicable
to items 155.20 and 155.30 of the TSUS
are appropriate to carry out the Inter-
national Sugar Agreement, 1977, and that
portion of the Kennedy Round Trade
agreement set forth in the Headnote, and
as provided for in the Headnote, give due
consideration to the interests in the
United States sugar market of domestic
producers and materially affected con-
tracting parties to the General Agreement
on Tariffs and Trade.
NOW, THEREFORE, I, JIMMY CARTER,
President of the United States of America,
acting under the authority vested in me by
the Constitution and statutes, including
section 201 of the Trade Expansion Act
of 1962, and in conformity with Head-
note 2, Subpart A of Part 10 of Schedule
1, of the TSUS, do hereby proclaim until
otherwise superseded by law:
A. Headnote 3 of Subpart A, Part 10,
Schedule 1 of the TSUS is modified to
provide as follows:
(3) The total amount of sugars, sirups,
and molasses described in items 155.20
and 155.30, the products of all foreign
countries, entered, or withdrawn from
warehouse, for consumption in any calen-
dar year shall not exceed, in the aggre-
gate, 6,900,000 short tons, raw value. Of
this quantity, not more than 210,987 short
2105
