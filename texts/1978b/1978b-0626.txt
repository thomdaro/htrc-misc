• Assuring that productivity concerns
are taken into account in regulatory
policy-Office of Management and

Improved productivity is vital to the
social and economic well-being of our Na-

major contribution to improving produc-
tivity. I expect all agencies to cooperate
with and assist the Council in meeting its
responsibilities so we realize maximum
benefit from the Federal effort to im-
prove productivity growth.
