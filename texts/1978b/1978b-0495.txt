Customs Procedural Reform and
Simplification Act of 1978
Statement on Signing H.R. 8149 Into Law.
October 4, 1978
I have signed H.R. 8149, the Customs
Procedural Reform and Simplification
Act of 1978. This is the first major legis-
lation in more than 20 years to streamline
Customs clearance of merchandise and
passengers.
During those 20 years, the value of U.S.
imports and duties collected has increased
fivefold; the number of travelers entering
the United States each year has more than
doubled, from 130 million to over 270
million.
This bill responds to that growth in
three major ways. First, it enables the Cus-
toms Service to improve procedures for
handling the documentary and financial
aspects of import transactions, while en-
suring timely collection of import statis-
tics. Second, it expedites Customs proced-
ures for processing goods and travelers at
a reduced administrative cost. Third, it
ensures due process of law for persons ac-
cused of Customs violations.
Under this new law, the Customs Serv-
ice can improve its automation in proc-
essing imports and reducing the number
of financial transactions between import-
ers and the Government. I am especially
pleased with the increase in the personal
exemption for travelers from $100 to $300
and the new 10 percent rate of duty for
all tourist purchases, which, along with
expedited passenger clearance, will make
entering the country a quicker and more
pleasant experience.
The tourist economies of the Virgin
Islands, Guam, and American Samoa will
also benefit from an increase of $200 to
$600 in the personal exemption, 5 per-
cent flat rate of duty for all goods pur-
chased in those islands, and a new provi-
sion which permits the exemption and the
flat rate to apply to purchases shipped
home as well as those accompanying the
traveler.
My administration is strongly commit-
ted to eliminating cumbersome proced-
ures, reducing paperwork, facilitating the
flow of world trade, and improving the
Government's responsiveness to the needs
of the traveling public. This bill addresses
each of these goals. I am pleased to sign
it.
NOTE: As enacted, H.R. 8149 is Public Law
95-410, approved October 3.
