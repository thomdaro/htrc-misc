Administration of Jimmy Carter, 1978
Oct. 31
Congressional Delegate for the
Territory of American Samoa
Statement on Signing H.R. 13702 Into Law.
October 31, 1978
Today I am signing into law H.R.
13702, which provides the territory of
American Samoa with a nonvoting Dele-
gate to the United States House of Rep-
resentatives. American Samoa became a
member of the American political family
through a voluntary act of cession by the
chiefs of Tutuila and Manua at the turn
of the century. Since that time, the peo-
ple of American Samoa have demon-
strated their attachment to this Nation by
their patriotic service in the Armed Forces
and have contributed greatly to our sports
and cultural life.
American Samoa has made significant
strides toward self-government in union
with the United States. In 1960 American
Samoans adopted their own locally
drafted constitution, which was approved
by the Secretary of the Interior. In 1969
American Samoan leaders began to take
President's Commission on
Foreign Language and
International Studies
Executive Order 12090. October 31, 1978
By the authority vested in me as Presi-
dent by the Constitution and statutes of
the United States of America, in order to
extend for five months the life of the
President's Commission on Foreign Lan-
guage and International Studies, Section
4 of Executive Order No. 12054 of April
21, 1978, is amended to read as follows:
"Sec. 4. Termination and Final Report.
The Commission shall submit its final re-
port to the President not later than eleven
months after its first meeting and shall
terminate thirty days thereafter.".

an active part in the territory's budgetary National Climate Program
process. In 1970 the people of American
Samoa elected a delegate at large to rep-
resent them in Washington, and in 1977
they elected their own Governor.
The United States should recognize, in
view of this history, that American Samoa
is a permanent part of American political
life, deserving of representation in the
United States Congress. The American
Samoa Delegate legislation provides that
recognition.
By signing this bill, I am signaling to
the world that the United States remains
committed to the well-being of American
Samoa, to the development of democratic
representation, and to our close brother-
hood with the people of American Samoa.
NOTE: As enacted, H.R. 13702 is Public Law
95-556, approved October 31.
Memorandum From the President.

Memorandum for the Heads of Depart-
ments and Agencies
I have just signed into law the National
Climate Program Act (P.L. 95-367). I
am pleased to commit the Nation to this
Program of improving our understanding
of climatic changes, both natural and
man-induced.
Much of the responsibility for imple-
menting this Act falls on the Secretary of
Commerce. In addition to those responsi-
bilities specifically assigned to the Secre-
tary of Commerce in the Act, I shall also
