Message to the Congress. November 30, 1978
To the Congress of the United States:
In accordance with the Impoundment
Control Act of 1974, I herewith propose
rescission of $75,000 in unneeded funds
appropriated to the Foreign Claims Set-
tlement Commission.
In addition, I am reporting four new
deferrals of budget authority totalling
$889 million and two revisions to pre-
viously transmitted deferrals increasing
the amount deferred by $21.4 million in
budget authority. These items involve the
military assistance program and programs
in the Departments of Commerce, De-
fense, Justice, and State.
The details of the rescission proposal
and the deferrals are contained in the at-
tached reports.
