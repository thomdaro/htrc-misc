Message to the Congress Transmitting a
Report. September 27, 1978
To the Congress of the United States:
I am pleased to submit to the Congress
the first annual report on science and
technology as required by the National
Science and Technology Policy, Orga-
nization, and Priorities Act of 1976.
Science and technology contribute in
significant ways to many of our social
needs-maintaining economic growth and
productivity, feeding the world's people,
improving our health and environment,
and preserving our national security. They
also reveal the basic structure of nature.
Moreover, our science and technology
draw the respect and admiration of na-
tions throughout the world.
I believe this report, and its successors,
can play an important role in providing a
foundation for informed debate on scien-
tific and technological issues, and thereby
can help assure that our scientific and
technological capabilities remain strong.
