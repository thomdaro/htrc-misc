Dear Mr. President:
In connection with the "Framework
for Peace in the Middle East", I am writ-
ing you this letter to inform you of the
position of the Arab Republic of Egypt,
with respect to the implementation of the
comprehensive settlement.
To ensure the implementation of the
provisions related to the West Bank and
Gaza and in order to safeguard the legiti-
mate rights of the Palestinian people,
Egypt will be prepared to assume the
Arab role emanating from these provi-
sions, following consultations with Jordan
and the representatives of the Palestinian
people.

United Nations Fund for Drug
Abuse Control
September 22, 1978
Statement by the President.
For over 70 years, the United States
of America has supported international
measures to control drug abuse. Today,
it is more important than ever to con-
tinue this support.
This administration recognizes that
drug problems cannot be solved unilat-
erally but require concerted action by the
world community. Drug abuse is exacting
an ever greater toll on the citizens of
developed and developing countries. It
affects our economies, our societies, and,
most of all, our culture.
The United Nations Fund for Drug
Abuse Control has played a central role
in this international effort. Despite lim-
ited funds it has been remarkably effec-
tive in finding cooperative ways for
nations to work together on this inter-
national problem. Today I am pleased to
announce that the United States will
contribute $3 million to the Fund in 1978.
