Dear Mr. President,
I am writing you to reaffirm the posi-
tion of the Arab Republic of Egypt with
respect to Jerusalem:
1. Arab Jerusalem is an integral part
of the West Bank. Legal and his-
torical Arab rights in the City must
be respected and restored.
2. Arab Jerusalem should be under
Arab sovereignty.
3. The Palestinian inhabitants of Arab
Jerusalem are entitled to exercise
their legitimate national rights,
being part of the Palestinian People
in the West Bank.
4. Relevant Security Council Resolu-
tions, particularly Resolutions 242
and 267, must be applied with re-
gard to Jerusalem. All the measures
taken by Israel to alter the status of
the City are null and void and
should be rescinded.
5. All peoples must have free access to
the City and enjoy the free exercise
of worship and the right to visit and
transit to the holy places without
distinction or discrimination.
6. The holy places of each faith may
be placed under the administration
and control of their representatives.
7. Essential functions in the City
should be undivided and a joint
municipal council composed of an
equal number of Arab and Israeli
members can supervise the carrying
out of these functions. In this way,
the City shall be undivided.
Sincerely,
(signed)

Dear Mr. President,
17 September 1978
I have the honor to inform you, Mr.
President, that on 28 June 1967-Israel's
Parliament (The Knesset) promulgated
and adopted a law to the effect: "the Gov-
ernment is empowered by a decree to ap-
ply the law, the jurisdiction and adminis-
tration of the State to any part of Eretz
Israel (land of Israel-Palestine), as
stated in that decree."
On the basis of this law, the Govern-
ment of Israel decreed in July 1967 that
Jerusalem is one city indivisible, the Capi-
tal of the State of Israel.
Sincerely,
(signed)
MENACHEM BEGIN
