Letter to Members of the House Judiciary
Committee. July 12, 1978
Next week, the Judiciary Committee
will be voting on H.J. Res. 638, which
would extend the time for ratification of
the Equal Rights Amendment. I am writ-
ing to let you, and other members of the
Committee, know of my strong support
for an extension of the deadline beyond
March 22, 1979.
The Equal Rights Amendment is a long
overdue addition to our Constitution: it
will guarantee equal rights for all Amer-
icans, regardless of sex. I commend you,
and the Judiciary Committee, for your
efforts in 1972 proposing the Amend-
ment and your vital support, since then,
for ratification.
I am hopeful that ERA will be ratified
before the present deadline expires, and
I am committed to doing whatever I can
to help the ratification process. But I am
concerned that the current deadline may
be an unnecessary barrier toward ensur-
ing more than a hundred million Amer-
icans their constitutional rights. I do not
believe that, just as we move so close to
ensuring those rights, the struggle for
ERA must be ended because of an orig-
inal seven year deadline.
There is no constitutional requirement
that ratification occur within a seven year
period, nor within the period originally
established for ratification. Under the
Constitution, in the opinion of the Jus-
tice Department, Congress is empowered
to determine the period of ratification and
