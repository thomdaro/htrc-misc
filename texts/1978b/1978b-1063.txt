March of Dimes Birth Defects
Prevention Month, January 1979
Statement by the President.
December 18, 1978
Fifteen million persons in America to-
day have birth defects. Low birthweight
is the most common root of such prob-
lems. It is not only the leading cause of
infant mortality in this country, but also
a major factor in disability during child-
hood. Thanks to the medical progress we
have made, newborns weighing less than
two and one-half pounds now have an al-
most fifty percent chance of survival.
Only a few years ago their chances were
less than twenty percent. But even with
greatly improved newborn intensive care,
many survivors are physically and men-
tally scarred for life. With proper nutri-
tion and adequate care during preg-
nancy, low birthweight, like so many
defects, can very often be prevented.
birth
Another 200,000 babies are born each
year with structural or metabolic defects.
In addition, many disabling and life-
shortening disorders have their origin
during pregnancy and birth. Many times
these are not thought of as birth defects
because symptoms may not appear until
later in life.
It is my hope that during 1979, the
International Year of the Child, we will
marshal our best efforts to make repro-
ductive health the focus of our priority
national attention. We must assure every
child the right to a healthy start in life.
We must join with other nations of the
world in protecting the well-being of
children the most precious resource of
all.
Prevention of birth defects has long
been the special mission of the March of
Dimes. In every community of this coun-
try the March of Dimes has initiated edu-
cational and medical service programs to
protect the unborn and newborn. It has
increased the availability of prenatal care,
started and supported programs to im-
prove maternal nutrition, created a na-
tionwide group of genetic centers and
established and assisted newborn inten-
sive care units. It has built a productive
partnership with the community, the pro-
fessions and government at all levels--
and proved how much can be accom-
plished by such a cooperative effort.
As we observe January 1979 as March
of Dimes Birth Defects Prevention
Month, let us thank the March of Dimes
for its critical leadership in this vital task,
and let us strengthen our national com-
