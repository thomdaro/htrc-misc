Natural Gas Legislation
Statement on Senate Action on the
Conference Committee Report.
September 19, 1978
The Senate's vote today on the natural
gas compromise is an important step to-
ward putting in place a comprehensive
national energy policy. The compromise
is a good bill for the Nation, and it is
vitally important that the Congress adopt
it. I am confident the courage and deter-
mination shown by the Senate today will
prevail in the week ahead, and I urge all
the bill's supporters who made this vote
possible today to redouble their efforts in
both the Senate and the House so that en-
actment of the national energy act will
not be delayed any further.
NOTE: Earlier the Senate had voted not to
recommit the report to the conference com-
mittee with instructions for certain changes in
the legislation.

Remarks at Groundbreaking Ceremonies at
the National Aviation Facilities Experimental
Center. September 20, 1978
Senator Case, Senator Williams, Gov-
ernor Brendan Byrne, Congressman
Hughes, Director Bob Faith, Chairman
Al Marks, all the members of the New
Jersey congressional delegation who are
assembled here this morning, wonderful
workers at the National Aviation Facilities
Experimental Center, NAFEC:
I want to say how glad I am to be
with you on this momentous occasion.
When I ran for President 2 years ago,
I didn't carry all the districts in New Jer-
sey, but I carried this one by a very strong
majority. When I left the White House
earlier this morning, my wife reminded me
that the reason was that I did not come to
the Second District during the campaign,
she came here. [Laughter] And I thank
you for that expression of confidence in
my wife.
It is a good day for the world. It's a
good day for our Nation. It's a good day
for New Jersey. It's a good day for this
community. I'm delighted to be here to
participate in breaking ground for
NAFEC's new building program.
