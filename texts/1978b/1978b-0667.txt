1978 Nobel Peace Prize
Message of Congratulations to Recipients
President Anwar al-Sadat of Egypt and
Prime Minister Menahem Begin of Israel.
October 27, 1978
Today the world is sending you its con-
gratulations. In honoring you with its
Peace Prize, the Nobel Committee has
ratified a decision already made by mil-
lions around the world.
I add my own congratulations, for this
honor you so fully deserve.
Through all the generations of leaders
in your region of the world, none have
wanted peace more than the two of you—
and none have taken the risks, or dis-
played the courage, that you have in this
quest. I know that the Middle East would
not be so near to peace today were it not
for
your determined efforts, and I know
that the same qualities that have earned
you this award will guide your nations
toward the lasting peace that all peoples
of your region desire.
The work you have done so far must
not be left uncompleted. Everything I
have learned about your character, your
commitments, and your courage gives me
confidence that the promise of this
moment will be fulfilled.

Bill To Rename a Federal
Building for Justice William O.
Douglas
Statement on Signing S. 3540 Into Law.
October 27, 1978
I am pleased and honored to sign
S. 3540, a bill to rename the Federal
building in Yakima, Washington, for one
of the town's and the Nation's most
respected and beloved citizens—Justice
William O. Douglas.
Justice Douglas' distinguished career
on the United States Supreme Court
spanned 36 years, the longest service on
the Court in history. This remarkable man
is respected around the world for the
leadership and compassion he has shown
as a fierce protector of individual rights,
an advocate of the defenseless against
oppression, and an activist on behalf of
environmental preservation.
Justice Douglas richly deserves the
recognition Congress has provided him
by passing this bill.
NOTE: As enacted, S. 3540 is Public Law 95-
538, approved October 27.
1877
