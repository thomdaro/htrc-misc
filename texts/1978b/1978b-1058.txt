them that we could, that the Chinese
knew this. And we will ask the Congress
for special legislation quite early in the
session to permit this kind of exchange
with the people of Taiwan. This would
include authorization for the Eximbank
and OPEC to guarantee and to help with
specific trade negotiations.
I think that many of their concerns
have been alleviated, although there cer-
tainly will be some Members of the Con-
gress who feel that we should have main-
tained the status quo.
I'll take just one question.
Q. Mr. President, you said the response
to your speech would be "massive ap-
plause throughout the Nation." What do
you think the response to your speech will
be in Taiwan?
THE PRESIDENT. I doubt if there will
be massive applause in Taiwan, but we
are going to do everything we can to as-
sure the Taiwanese that we put at top-
as one of the top priorities in our own re-
lationships with the People's Republic
and them-that the well-being of the
people of Taiwan will not be damaged.
To answer the other question, I don't
think this will have any adverse effect at
all on the SALT negotiations as an inde-
pendent matter. And I think that the So-
viets, as I said earlier, have been expect-
ing this development. They were not
surprised, and we have kept them in-
formed recently. Their reaction has not
been adverse, and we will proceed ag-
gressively as we have in recent months, in
fact throughout my own administration,
to conclude a successful SALT agree-
ment.
Good night.
NOTE: The President spoke at approximately
9:30 p.m. to reporters assembled in the Brief-
ing Room at the White House. Following his

ground briefing on the announcement.
