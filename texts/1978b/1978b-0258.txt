Federal Civil Service Reform
Statement on Senate Passage of the Legislation.
August 24, 1978
The Senate's overwhelming vote this
evening in favor of civil service reform is
a crucial victory in the battle to cut waste
and make Government more efficient.
The Senators who supported my civil
service reform proposal deserve the grati-
tude of every taxpayer in the United
States. I particularly want to thank Sen-
ators Byrd, Ribicoff, and Percy. Their
dedicated work was indispensable to pass-
ing a sound civil service reform bill.
