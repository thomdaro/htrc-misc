Administration of Jimmy Carter, 1978
and changed our position, possibly for his
home State influence.
But we've explained that, I think,
today, the ones that worked out the agree-
ment with him. The Vice President and
Stu Eizenstat and Jim Schlesinger were
the ones that talked to Senator McClure
about what our position was. And I think
it was a very brief discussion.
Q. What Senators have you spoken to?
THE PRESIDENT. Well, I'd rather not
give you a list of names-but enough, I
hope.
MR. POWELL. That's enough. You
won't get all-
Q. They ask if you were enjoying your
vacation?
THE PRESIDENT. That's a silly ques-

or three times. I think we'll probably go

go away from here to fish?

THE PRESIDENT. On this lake-we had
a briefing from one of the fishermen
here this lake is 400 feet deep, over 400
feet, and you fish deep for large lake
trout. And we'll do some of that. We'll
probably go up in the upper lake, Yellow-
stone, and fish a while, and maybe go to
one of the streams and wade some and do
some fly-fishing.
Q. I meant, did they ask you whether
you were enjoying your vacation. The
Senators.
THE PRESIDENT. Oh, you mean the
folks back in Washington. Yes, they all
envy us. I think I've got enough folks lined
up in the Senate that want to go down
the Middle Fork of the Salmon to keep
them busy for a while. [Laughter] It's
good to see you all.
REPORTER. Thank you.
NOTE: The exchange began at 5:10 p.m. at
the dock near Brinkerhoff Lodge.
Pope John Paul I
Message to His Holiness on His Election.
August 26, 1978
Your Holiness:
On behalf of the American people, I
join people the world over in welcoming
your election as Pontiff of the Roman
Catholic Church. We rejoice in the
renewal of leadership for your Church.
In a world of rapid change, the basic
needs of humanity remain the same:
peace, justice, equity and the opportunity

supreme challenges that face us. Your

your predecessors, can be an inspiration
and a hope for all those who struggle to
meet those challenges. I pray it will be
heard and echoed by people of good will
throughout the world.

Your Holiness my deep respect and sin-
cere good wishes for your Papacy.
