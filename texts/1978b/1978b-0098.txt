Administration of Jimmy Carter, 1978
cided myself about the advisability of this
action.
Q. Are you still hoping for Congress to
act to prevent you having to impose
quotas?
THE PRESIDENT. Yes, I hope the Con-
gress will act on the entire package. As
you know, the conference committees
have agreed on four-fifths of it, which
encompass an energy saving of about 2.3
million barrels per day. The remaining
portion concerning the tax on oil would
result in an additional 2 or 300,000 barrels
a day.
So, the major portion of it has at least
been agreed to by the conference com-
mittees, and I hope that Congress will act
without delay.
Q. Are you pleased?
THE PRESIDENT. Yes, I'm pleased.
REPORTER. Thank you, Mr. President.

The heads of state and government,
