Administration of Jimmy Carter, 1978
Nov. 22
First Anniversary of the
National Women's Conference
Statement by the President.
November 20, 1978
I take great pleasure in marking the 1-
year anniversary of the first National
Women's Conference in Houston, Texas.
I think the most meaningful manner in
which I can take note of that historic
occasion is to call, once again, for ratifica-
tion of the equal rights amendment.
Many women who were delegates to
Houston and to the State conventions
which preceded the Houston conference
were active in the recent successful effort
to extend the ratification deadline 3 more
years. My administration and members of
my family enthusiastically supported that
effort.
This week women all over the country
who attended the Houston conference are
measuring the progress on the plan of
action they adopted 1 year ago. I have
recently released a report indicating my
administration's action in furtherance of
that plan for women's equality.
We will continue to work to realize
other goals set forth by the women's con-
ference. It is in the national interest for
all citizens to participate fully in every
part of American life.
