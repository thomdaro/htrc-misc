Administration of Jimmy Carter, 1978
National Health Plan
Statement by Secretary of Health, Education,
and Welfare Joseph A. Califano, Jr.
July 28, 1978
I just have a brief statement which I
will read, and then we will deal with the
general subject tomorrow at HEW, as you
know.
This administration is deeply com-
mitted to the goal of decent health care
for every American, as our legislative pro-
posals to date have demonstrated. This
will be further evident tomorrow when
we announce the principles on which the
administration's national health plan will
be based.
We are also deeply concerned that our
national health plan be prudently de-
signed, be phased in in a reasonable and
cautious manner, reflect economic and
budgetary realities, and avoid the imposi-
tion of excessive costs on the average
American taxpayer.
Above all, we are committed to pro-
ceeding in a prudent manner which does
not fuel inflationary pressures.
The President of the United States has
broad responsibilities. In devising any pro-
gram, however basic or important, the
President must always bear in mind the
impact of that program on other elements
of national life and policy, especially on
the economy, in inflationary times such as
these.
NOTE: Secretary Califano read the statement
at 5:23 p.m. to reporters assembled in the
Briefing Room at the White House. As printed
above, this item follows the text of the White
House press release.
