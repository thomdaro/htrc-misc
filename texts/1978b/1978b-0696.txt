Administration of Jimmy Carter, 1978
proposed major rules and in exploring al-
ternative approaches. The group discusses
and submits formal comments on 10 to 20
of the most important regulations pro-
posed each year. Today, I am extending
this program through June 30, 1980.
The above steps will further improve
the process of issuing new regulations. The
Executive Order also requires agencies to
prepare lists of existing regulations for
"sunset" review. As part of my effort to
eliminate unnecessarily inflationary regu-
lations, I am asking you to review these
lists and identify additional major regu-
lations which can be modified or elimi-
nated to reduce costs. Candidates for such
reviews should be submitted to OMB by
December 1, 1978.
These steps will accelerate our progress
toward a regulatory system that meets the
needs of the public at the least cost. Your
personal attention to this effort is essen-
tial to its success.

Occupational Discrimination
Based on Pregnancy
Statement on Signing S. 995 Into Law.
October 31, 1978
I am pleased to sign into law today
legislation that protects American women
from occupational discrimination on the
basis of pregnancy.
I am convinced that discrimination
based on pregnancy, childbirth, and re-
lated medical conditions constitutes dis-
crimination based on sex. As its passage
of this bill shows, the Congress shares
that conviction-and shares as well my
unalterable opposition to such discrimina-
tion.
This bill, an amendment to title VII
of the historic Civil Rights Act of 1964,
stands for the principle of equal justice
under law. It does not bestow favored
treatment on America's 42 million work-
ing women. Nor does it diminish in any
way the rights and benefits of their male
coworkers. It simply requires employers
who have medical disability plans to pro-
vide for disability due to pregnancy and
related conditions on an equal basis with
other medical conditions.
This legislation does not introduce any
novel employment practices. Some States
already prohibit sex discrimination based
on pregnancy. Under this new law, this
kind of protection now applies to all
workers throughout the country covered
by title VII.
NOTE: As enacted, S. 995 is Public Law 95-
555, approved October 31.
