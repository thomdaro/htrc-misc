Sept. 11
Administration of Jimmy Carter, 1978
Veterans Day, 1978
Proclamation 4595. September 11, 1978
By the President of the United States
of America
A Proclamation
Among the great days of national re-
membrance, none is more deeply moving
to Americans than Veterans Day. On this
occasion, our nation traditionally joins
together to salute those valiant individuals
who have served in the Armed Forces.
This is a very special day. It symbolizes
the debt of gratitude we owe our veterans.
It reminds us that the freedom we enjoy
has endured intact because millions of
patriotic men and women answered their
country's call to service and sacrifice.
Our veterans have not sought glory for
themselves, but peace and freedom for us
all. They represent the spirit that has pre-
served us as a great nation. They deserve
our recognition for all they have done.
NOW, THEREFORE, I, JIMMY CARTER,
President of the United States of America,
invite all Americans to observe Saturday,
November 11, 1978, as Veterans Day and
on this historic occasion, let us resolve
anew to keep faith with those whose love
of country has set them in an imperish-
able roll of honor.
I urge all the families and friends of
our sick and disabled veterans to visit
them and extend to them a grateful na-
tion's promise that they will not be for-
gotten.
I call upon Federal, State, and local
Government officials to mark Veterans
Day by displaying the flag of the United
States, and by encouraging and support-
ing public involvement in appropriate
ceremonies throughout the country.
IN WITNESS WHEREOF, I have here-
unto set my hand this eleventh day of
September, in the year of our Lord, nine-
teen hundred and seventy-eight, and of
the Independence of the United States
of America, the two hundred and third.
JIMMY CARTER
