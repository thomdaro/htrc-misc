Dear Mr. Speaker: (Dear Mr. Presi-

In accordance with Section 203 (b) (2)
of the Trade Act of 1974, enclosed is a

IMPORT RELIEF ARTIFICIAL BAITS AND
FLIES
As required under Section 203(b) (2)
of the Trade Act of 1974, I am trans-
mitting this report to Congress setting
forth my decision with respect to artificial
baits and flies covered by the affirmative
finding on September 21, 1978, of the
U.S. International Trade Commission
(USITC) under Section 201 (d) (1) of
the Trade Act. As I have determined not

million dozen were imported in 1977 even
though, in the interim, import prices
dropped 30 percent and domestic prices.
nearly doubled.
2. Latest (January-April 1978) eco-
nomic indicators for this industry show an
improved market situation. Compared to
a similar period last year, domestic ship-
ments are up 1 percent in value, 6 percent
in quantity, employment increased 12
percent and the number of hours worked
are up 50 percent. Finally, the domestic
industry's share of the domestic market
has improved.

Domestic Artificial Baits and
Flies Industry
Memorandum From the President.

Memorandum for the Special Represent-
ative for Trade Negotiations
Subject: Determination Under Section
to provide import relief, I have included 202(b) of the Trade Act; Artificial Baits
the reasons for my decision.
I have determined that the import re-
lief is not in the national economic inter-
est for the following reasons:
1. Because of the existing large differ-
ence in prices between imports and like
or similar domestically produced artificial
baits and flies the import relief recom-
mended by the USITC would not be
effective. Domestically made items sell for
an average of $6-$7 per dozen. Imports
sell for an average of $2-$3 per dozen.
Moreover, the level of imports has barely
changed over the five years-5.0 million
and Flies
Pursuant to Section 202 (b) (1) of the
Trade Act of 1974 (P.L. 93-618, 88 Stat.
1978), I have determined the action I will
take with respect to the report of the
United States International Trade Com-
mission (USITC) dated September 21,
1978, on the results of its investigation
concerning artificial baits and flies pro-
vided for in Item 731.60 of the Tariff
Schedules of the United States.
After considering all relevant aspects of
the case, including those set forth in Sec-
tion 202(c) of the Trade Act of 1974,
I have determined that import relief
