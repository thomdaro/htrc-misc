United States Relations With
the People on Taiwan
Memorandum From the President.
December 30, 1978
Memorandum for All Departments and
Agencies
Subject: Relations with the People on
Taiwan
As President of the United States, I
have constitutional responsibility for the
conduct of the foreign relations of the
nation. The United States has announced
that on January 1, 1979, it is recognizing
the government of the People's Republic
of China as the sole legal government of
China and is terminating diplomatic rela-
tions with the Republic of China. The
United States has also stated that, in the
future, the American people will maintain
commercial, cultural and other relations
with the people of Taiwan without official
government representation and without
diplomatic relations. I am issuing this
memorandum to facilitate maintaining
those relations pending the enactment
of legislation on the subject.
I therefore declare and direct that:
(A) Departments and agencies cur-
rently having authority to conduct or
carry out programs, transactions, or other
relations with or relating to Taiwan are
directed to conduct and carry out those
programs, transactions, and relations be-
ginning January 1, 1979, in accordance
with such authority and, as appropriate,
through the instrumentality referred to in
paragraph D below.
(B) Existing international agreements
and arrangements in force between the
United States and Taiwan shall continue
in force and shall be performed and en-
forced by departments and agencies be-
ginning January 1, 1979, in accordance
with their terms and, as appropriate,
through that instrumentality.
