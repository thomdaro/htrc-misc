with Federal judges and so forth-but
that's a long-range processâ€”and, through
my own public statements, can certainly
help modify general attitudes on deregu-
lation.
In the unique case of the airlines, I had
a major input because of foreign policy
considerations, and we rapidly deregu-
lated the airline industry in international
flights. And I think that to the degree that
that proved to be successful for the air-
lines themselves, for passenger loads and
so forth, it made it easier for us to pass
legislation deregulating the domestic air-
line industry.
I think on deregulation, I would have
to characterize myself as the one who has
the broadest perspective and who makes
the ultimate judgments, which may disap-
point you, but I hope it doesn't. [Laugh-
ter]
Let me say in closing that I'd like to
stay with you. I know you have other busi-
ness to carry out. But I'm very deeply
grateful to you, and I hope that my per-
formance is meeting with your approval.
I have many groups and many distin-
guished Americans who give me aid and
assistance, advice and counsel, criticism,
and you are in the forefront of those peo-
ple. I trust your judgment. I will have to
make the ultimate decisions that affect
our country.
Sometimes a particular request or sug-
gestion of yours runs counter to other in-
terests that I have to accommodate, but in
general, I think that we have grown to
understand and respect one another in
the last 2 years. And I hope that you will
feel that through your organizational
leaders or directly to me or through my
Cabinet officers or agency heads or ad-
visers, that you have a constant access and
easy access to the decisionmaking portion
of the Federal Government.
I'm indebted to you. I look forward to
working with you closely in the future,
and I hope that you will not take lightly
my direct, personal request that you not
only adopt but encourage others to adopt
the voluntary guidelines on wages and
prices that I have put forward. That is
the best thing that you can do for me at
this point. And if you fail me in that,
then I would be not quite so grateful in
the future as I am now. [Laughter]
Thank you.
