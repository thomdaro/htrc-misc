Gerald R. Ford, 1975
I think that is my job as President. And I think it is the responsibility of the
American people. There is no reason why we shouldn't. We have the potential.
We have the people. We have everything to do it with. And I just hope we will
move ahead.
MR. CRONKITE. Thank you very much, Mr. President, and good night, sir.
MR. SEVAREID. Thank you, Mr. President.
MR. SCHIEFFER. Thank you, Mr. President.

Statement on the Death of Franklin Rockefeller Little.
April 22, 1975
MRS. FORD and I join with the people of New York State and with all Amer-
icans who cherish a free and vigorous press in mourning the passing of Franklin
Rockefeller Little.
As the owner, editor, and publisher of a number of newspapers in New York,
Franklin Little distinguished himself as a man who was devoted to the truth
and to informing his many readers of the truth and the meaning of eventsâ€”
great and small. His expert and incisive commentary on the major issues of his
time was his trademark. He left his imprint as well on a host of endeavors for
the public good.
For more than half a century, newspapering was his work, and it is now his
proud legacy to those who will follow him. An outstanding public servant, a
man who never lost the reporter's instinct for news, Franklin Little has left a
great void in his own profession and in the State and Nation he served with such
distinction.
NOTE: Mr. Little was chairman of the New York Publishing Company.
