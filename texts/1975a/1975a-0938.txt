Remarks Following a Meeting With Soviet Transpolar
Aviators. June 23, 1975
Ambassador Dobrynin, General Belyakov, General Baidukov, Colonel Chkalov:
Let me welcome all of you to the White House. I know this is the second
experience for the two generals and the first experience of Colonel Chkalov.
In 1937, these two generals and another flew from Moscow to Vancouver,
Washington, in 62 hours, and this plane is a duplicate of the plane that they
flew on this historic flight.
The three Soviet military personnel who are here with us here today spent
several days in Vancouver last week in a celebration of the flight that took
place almost 40 years ago.
I was just looking at the logbook in English that showed the various incidents
that took place as they flew on this really historic flight in 1937. And the three
gentlemen here within the last week or so flew in a modern Russian jet. It took
them 10 hours. So, the flight that they took almost 40 years ago took six times
as long as the flight they made over the same area in 1975.
General Belyakov has just presented to me this replica of the aircraft that
they flew in, a single-engine, piston-driven plane that the two of them and the
father of the colonel made in this flight from the Soviet Union to the United
States.
But the point I think is appropriate to makeâ€”this warm welcome given to
the Soviet pilots is an indication of the progress we have made in a people-to-
