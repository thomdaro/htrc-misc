Gerald R. Ford, 1975
and myself with the Members of Congress on the respective committeesâ€”will
result in an approach that is comparable to mine, because I think the Congress
will pass that.
I have very grave doubts that the Congress would pass a gasoline tax. And
certainly my feeling in that regard was reaffirmed by 102 Democrats putting
their name on the line saying they would not vote for one. And I think there is
a better way to do it, and we are going to work with the chairman of the Com-
mittee on Ways and Means, hoping to find an answer that is more like the
approach that I have recommended.
Q. To follow that up, you did say a gasoline tax of the magnitude that is
being proposed by some. I seem to note a shift in your position there. Now,
Mr. Ullman has come down from 40 cents to possibly 25 cents. If he were to
come down a little further, would you be willing to talk about maybe a 20
cent tax?
The President. I read a news report a few minutes ago which said that the
bill that he had introduced included a gas tax up to 37 cents over a 3- or 4-year
span. I don't think that is the right approach, and I don't think it is feasible in
trying to get the Congress to act. Therefore, I go back to a program that we
proposed which I think will be the answer, which I think the Congress
eventually will buy substantially.
I am very happy that we are negotiating. We are trying to find an answer
with Mr. Ullman, the chairman of the Committee on Ways and Means, and I am
encouraged by what I understand is the progress that is being made.
MR. CORMIER. Thank you, Mr. President.
The President. Thank you, Mr. Cormier. Thank you all very much.
