Remarks at the Swearing In of the Membership of the
Consumer Advisory Council. May 1, 1975
Mrs. Knauer, members of and prospective members of the consumer advisory
group:
Let me congratulate you, Virginia, and those that have worked with you and
to wish the new members well in their responsibilities, which I think are very
important, as we continue the efforts that have been made, hopefully to expand
them, to make sure, to make positive that the consumer is given the maximum
protection by all agencies of the Federal Government.
There is, of course, in my opinion, two very critical areas where the consumer
needs help: one, price; and two, quality. And quality, of course, covers a very
wide range.
I have asked Mrs. Knauer, with the help of this advisory group, to work with
all departments of the Federal Government. Each department, with her help
and assistance, will have within it a very important responsibilityâ€”that of help-
ing the consumer. She, of course, can get from this distinguished group the kind
of advice that is needed and necessary in order to make the Government's opera-
tion a successful one from the point of view of the consumer.
I have great faith in Mrs. Knauer. I believe this advisory group will contribute
significantly.
And so, it's a privilege and a pleasure for me at this time to ask Mr. Ratchford
to come forth and swear in the five new members of the Consumer Advisory
Council.
Mr. Ratchford.
