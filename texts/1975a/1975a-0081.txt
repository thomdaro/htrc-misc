Statement on Signing Bills Honoring Herbert Hoover
and Harry S. Truman. January 4, 1975
I HAVE signed two bills that honor former Presidents Herbert Hoover and
Harry S. Truman.
S. 1418, the Herbert Hoover memorial bill, authorizes the Secretary of the
Treasury to make available $7 million in matching grants to the Hoover Insti-
tution at Stanford University for the construction and equipping of a new
memorial building. This memorial building will complete the Hoover Institu-
tion's library and research complex. The addition of this building will make
the dream of Herbert Hoover in 1919, when the institution was founded, a
reality. With expanded facilities, the institution will be strengthened as a
national and international center for advanced research on the problems of the
20th century. It will make available to scholars and students from each of our
States and every country in the world the research facilities essential to academic
scholarship.
S. 3548, the Harry S Truman Memorial Scholarship Act, establishes a $30
million fund in the United States Treasury. These proceeds will be used by the
Truman Foundation to provide 4-year college scholarships on a competitive
basis to outstanding students interested in public service careers. There is no
fixed number of scholarships, but at least one must be awarded in each State
where there is a qualified applicant.
The Herbert Hoover memorial bill and the Harry S Truman Memorial
Scholarship Act create living memorials to two Presidents and honor their many
years of extraordinary and selfless public service. I am privileged to sign the
Hoover and Truman memorial legislation.
NOTE: As enacted, S. 1418, approved January 2,
1975, and S. 3548, approved January 4, are Public
Law 93-585 (88 Stat. 1918) and Public Law
93-642 (88 Stat. 2276), respectively.
