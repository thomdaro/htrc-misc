Remarks at the Swearing In of the Membership of the
Federal Election Commission. April 14, 1975
Members of the Congress, the designated members of the Commission, and
guests:
It is a great privilege for me to participate in the actual swearing in of these
six very distinguished individuals who will be undertaking a very serious
responsibility.
The campaign reform legislation, which was enacted by the Congress in 1974,
which I had the privilege of signing, is landmark legislation, and the respon-
sibilities that these five men and this one most attractive lady have is a responsi-
bility that I know they will take seriously.
It is a combination of individuals selected-two by myself and four by the
Congress-who can really, in the months and years ahead, set a path for the
kind of elections that we want.
We want clean elections. We want fair elections. We want the best people
campaigning and the best results as the American people decide.
I have great faith in all of them. I know some better than others, but as I
have looked over their records, I think the House and the Senate and the White
House have selected fine people for a great, great responsibility.
