Public Papers of the Presidents
And so, as a final tribute, I have a little poem about football coaches. And
with your permission I would like to read it. It goes something like this:
The football coach has a lonely job,
He rarely gets much credit.
And if he hears a kindly wordâ€”
This is the group that said it.
He labors hard to build the sport
In a manner almost stately.
But the only question he's ever asked
Is: "What have you won for us lately?"
And so, you coaches, hear my wish,
And don't sink into lethargy.
Have some fun-there are lots worse things
Than being burned in effigy! [Laughter]
Thank you and good night.
NOTE: The President spoke at 9:59 p.m. in the
International Ballroom at the Washington Hilton
Hotel. In his opening remarks, he referred to Bob
Blackman, president of the American Football
Coaches Association, and Gerald B. Zornow, chair-
man of the board of the Eastman Kodak Company,
which sponsored the awards.
Mr. Blackman presented the President with the
association's Tuss McLaughry Award for highest
distinction in service to others.

Address to the Nation on Energy and Economic Programs.
January 13, 1975
Good evening.
Without wasting words, I want to talk with you tonight about putting our
domestic house in order. We must turn America in a new direction. We must
reverse the current recession, reduce unemployment, and create more jobs.
We must restore the confidence of consumers and investors alike. We must
continue an effective plan to curb inflation. We must, without any delay, take
firm control of our progress as a free people.
Together we can and will do this job. Our national character is strong on
self-discipline and the will to win. Americans are at their very best when
the going is rough. Right now, the going is rough, and it may get rougher.
But if we do what must be done, we will be on our way to better days. We
have an historic opportunity.
