Letter to President Samora Moises Machel on United States
Recognition of Mozambique. June 25, 1975
Dear Mr. President:
I am pleased to inform you that the United States Government extends recog-
nition to Mozambique. It is our hope, with your agreement, that diplomatic
relations can soon be established between our two countries.
We congratulate your leaders and their Portuguese colleagues on the wise
statesmanship that has led to Mozambique's independence.
The American people share with the people of Mozambique the knowledge
that hard-won individual liberty and national independence can be preserved
only by unremitting labor and sacrifice.
As we strengthen and multiply our bonds of mutual friendship, I am confi-
dent of a future in which our two peoples will work together in the freedom,
peace and security of all mankind.
Sincerely,
GERALD R. FORD
[His Excellency Samora Moises Machel, President of the People's Republic of Mozambique]

Remarks to Participants in the National YMCA Youth
Governors Conference. June 26, 1975
LET ME congratulate all of you governors. I wish we could get the same
applause from the duly elected Governors when they come down to the White
House. I don't mean to be critical of them, because they have been very helpful
in many ways, but I am very grateful for your very warm reception, and I wish
to congratulate you on your election, your selection, and also the activities in
which you are participating.
I think it is appropriate also to say that I believe the Reader's Digest does a fine
job in making this program possible. Their support of it makes it feasible for all
of you to come down and get firsthand some insight into the Government here, to
get to know the people that are representing you in both the House and the
Senate, and to talk firsthand with individuals in the executive branch of the
Government.
