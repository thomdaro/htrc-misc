Memorandum of Disapproval of a Bill To Name a
Federal Building in Grand Rapids, Michigan, for the
President. January 4, 1975
I HAVE today vetoed H.R. 11897, a bill which would name the United States
Courthouse and Federal Office Building in Grand Rapids, Michigan, the â€œPresi-
dent Gerald R. Ford Federal Office Building."
Although I appreciate the honor expressed by the Congress in enacting this
legislation, I intend to continue the policy of past Administrations that the
executive branch not endorse the naming of Federal office buildings. Generally,
the executive branch has deferred to the desires of the Congress on such matters.
However, I know of no Federal office buildings that have been named for
a President while still in office. This legislation might begin a precedent I believe
it best not to establish.
The proposed naming of this facility for me in my home community is a
great honor, and one for which I am deeply grateful; however, for the reasons
I have assigned above I feel I cannot sign H.R. 11897.
