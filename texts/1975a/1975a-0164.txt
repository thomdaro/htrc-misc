Public Papers of the Presidents
over the past 25 years, I am reminded of how far America actually has come, of
how many barriers have fallen, and the number of prejudices that have been
laid to rest.
But more importantly, as I look ahead I know how much work remains before
every child born in America has the same opportunities for long life, economic
security, and educational achievement. Much has been done. Much remains. But
together we can make that necessary progress.
Thank you very, very much.
NOTE: The President spoke at 4:30 p.m. in Room
450 of the Old Executive Office Building to mem-
bers of the association attending a briefing by
Administration officials on the President's economic
and energy programs.
The President was introduced by Dr. Carlton
Goodlett, president of the association.

Statement on Representative John Jarman's Change in
Party Affiliation. January 23, 1975
THE ANNOUNCEMENT by Congressman John Jarman, of Oklahoma, that
he is changing his political party affiliation from the Democratic to the Repub-
lican Party reflects the sincere conviction of a dedicated Member of Congress.
I have known John Jarman throughout his 24 years of service in the U.S.
House of Representatives. His career has been marked by a devotion to his dis-
trict and dedication to reflecting accurately the views of those people he
represents.
John and I have discussed his becoming a Republican during recent days, and
he has indicated his belief that he can better represent and serve his district under
the banner of the Republican Party.
As President, I look forward to working with John during the 94th Congress.
His experience, integrity, and long seniority will be of great benefit to the Ad-
ministration and the GOP Congressional delegation.
As a Republican, I am delighted that John is changing his party affiliation and
welcome him to the ranks of the GOP on behalf of all Republicans.
