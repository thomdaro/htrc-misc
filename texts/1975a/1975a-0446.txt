Public Papers of the Presidents
Participation by military personnel in the cash awards program was author-
ized by the Congress in 1965. More than 1.6 million suggestions submitted since
that time attest to the success which the program has had as a means of motivat-
ing military men and women to seek ways of reducing costs and improving
efficiency. Of those suggestions submitted, more than 255,000 have been adopted
with resultant tangible first year benefits in excess of $799,000,000.
Of the nearly 146,009 suggestions which were submitted by military personnel
during Fiscal Year 1974, 19,810 were adopted. Cash awards totaling $1,358,818
were paid for these adopted suggestions, based not only on the tangible first-
year benefits of $71,461,841 which were realized therefrom, but also on many
additional benefits and improvements of an intangible nature. Enlisted person-
nel received $1,103,693 in awards which represent 82 percent of the total cash
awards paid. The remaining 18 percent was received by officer personnel and
amounted to $255,125.
Attached are reports of the Secretary of Defense and the Secretary of Trans-
portation containing statistical information on the military awards program and
brief descriptions of some of the more noteworthy contributions during Fiscal
Year 1974.

Remarks at the Swearing In of John T. Dunlop as
Secretary of Labor. March 18, 1975
John, Mr. Vice President, Members of the Congress, members of the Adminis-
tration, distinguished guests, ladies and gentlemen:
Perhaps this is telling tales out of school, but I understand that a few months
ago, when John Dunlop tried to attend the dedication of the new Department
of Labor headquarters, he could not get in because he did not have a ticket.
Today, John, it gives me a great deal of pleasure to present you with that ticket.
[Laughter]
I am very, very pleased to welcome the new Secretary of Labor, who is so
