On behalf of my father, we thank you very much and accept this award with
much appreciation and gratitude.
Thank you.
THE PRESIDENT. Now, the 1974 Aviator's Trophy: to a pilot who flew a C-5

In addition, between October 14 and November 14, 1973, he personally directed,
virtually without interruption, the operation of 15 C-5's and 417 C-141's from
the United States to the Azores and on to Israel.

On behalf of the dedicated men and women of the United States Air Force,
I humbly accept this recognition.
Thank you.

aircraft of the 57th Aerospace Rescue and Recovery Squadron of the United
States Air Force, nonstop, on February 20, 1972, from Taiwan to Scott Air Force
Base in Illinoisâ€”a total of 8,732 miles-without refueling. This established a
record for the longest flight in a straight line, without a landing, in a turbo-prop
aircraft.
