Southern and Southeastern States. They did raise that question, urging that I
release some of the deferrals or rescissions in the Highway Trust Fund. I mean
deferrals, not rescissions.
I have promised them that I will take a look at their recommendation. Some
of them said their States were ready to go, they could let bids within 30 days
and get construction underway very quickly.
I will talk to the Federal Highway Commissioner, former Governor Tiemann

and even here in Georgia, the State government is actively seeking Arab invest-
mentsâ€”I was wondering what your opinion was on the trend in this direction?
THE PRESIDENT. There have been some recent news stories to the effect that
the Iranian Government, for example, wanted to invest in Pan Am. They were
