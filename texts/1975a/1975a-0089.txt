I also believe that this new legislation significantly improves program ac-
countability and focuses funds on those most in need of services.
In summary, I regard the social services provisions as a major piece of domes-
tic legislation and a significant step forward in Federal-State relations.
NOTE: As enacted, H.R. 17045, approved January 4, 1975, is Public Law 93-647 (88 Stat. 2337).

Memorandum of Disapproval of a Bill To Extend Funding for
Rural Environmental Programs. January 4, 1975
[Dated January 3, 1975. Released January 4, 1975]
I AM withholding my approval from S. 3943, a bill "to extend the time for using
funds appropriated to carry out the 1973 Rural Environmental Assistance Pro-
gram and the 1974 Rural Environmental Conservation Program.‚Äù
The bill would extend from December 31, 1974, to December 31, 1975, the
time within which farmers may request and receive approval of cost-sharing
assistance under the 1973 Rural Environmental Assistance Program (REAP)
and the 1974 Rural Environmental Conservation Program (RECP). In total,
this bill would make $125,000,000 available to farmers for water and soil con-
servation practices which would otherwise not be available beyond December 31,
1974.
In my judgment, this bill is not necessary because sufficient cost-share funds
have been made available for producers to finance sound conservation practices.
Those producers interested in these programs have had adequate time to request
and receive approval of these cost-share funds by the end of December 1974. I
understand that those farmers, who have started approved conservation practices
during the allotted time and were unable to complete them because of weather
or other uncontrollable circumstances, will be permitted to complete these prac-
tices and receive cost-sharing assistance during 1975.
This Administration shares the view that REAP and RECP have made
important contributions to conservation and the rural environment. However,
the programs have long ago achieved their objectives. These programs were
initiated in the 1930's to supplement farmers' incomes and provide incentives to
farmers to install soil and water conservation practices. They were successful in
demonstrating the value of conservation as a good farming practice. Many of the
practices supported by the programs are profitable without Federal assistance
