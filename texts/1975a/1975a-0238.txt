Message on the Observance of the Chinese New Year.
February 3, 1975
ON THE occasion of the Chinese New Year, Mrs. Ford and I extend our very
best wishes to our fellow citizens of Chinese ancestry. We welcome this oppor-
tunity to give recognition of the many ways in which Chinese Americans en-
rich our way of life.
This occasion focuses on your achievements and provides your fellow citizens
with a better appreciation for the vast cultural traditions which the Chinese
people have given to mankind.
May the Year of the Hare bring each of you happiness and fulfillment, and
may it also bring greater prosperity and progress to our nation.

Message on the Observance of Black History Week.
February 3, 1975
IT IS most appropriate that Americans set aside a week to recognize the impor-
tant contribution made to our nation's life and culture by our black citizens.
With the growth of the civil rights movement has come a healthy awareness
on the part of all of us of achievements that have too long been obscured and
unsung. Emphasis on these achievements in our schools and colleges and in
daily community life places in timely perspective the benefits of working to-
gether as brothers and sisters regardless of race, religion or national origin for
the general well-being of all our society.
In this spirit, I urge my fellow citizens to be mindful of the valuable message
conveyed to us during the celebration of this week.
GERALD R. FORD
