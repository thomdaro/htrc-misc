Message to the Congress Transmitting Annual Report of
the United States-Japan Cooperative Medical Science
Program. July 8, 1975
To the Congress of the United States:
I am pleased to present to the Congress the Eighth Annual Report of the United
States-Japan Cooperative Medical Science Program. This bilateral research effort
in the biomedical sciences was successfully implemented in 1965 following a
meeting between the Prime Minister of Japan and the President of the United
States.
During 1974, this Program has continued to direct attention to the study and
prevention of a group of significant diseases which influence the health status
of the people of Asia: cholera, environmentally induced diseases, leprosy, mal-
nutrition, parasitic diseases (filariasis and schistosomiasis), tuberculosis, and
viral diseases (rabies, dengue-hemorrhagic fever and other selected arboviral
diseases).
The accomplishments attained during the past year are highlighted in the
report of the Program which I am submitting to Congress today. I look for-
ward to strengthening further the valuable and productive relationships pro-
vided by this model of cooperative international endeavor for the health benefits
of our fellow man.
The White House,
July 8, 1975.
