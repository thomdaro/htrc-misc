Letter to the Speaker of the House and the President of the
Senate Transmitting Proposed Legislation To Extend and
Revise the General Revenue Sharing Program.
April 25, 1975
ENCLOSED is a draft of a bill, "To extend and revise the State and Local
Fiscal Assistance Act of 1972."
The State and Local Fiscal Assistance Act of 1972 has provided vitally needed
funding to States and over 38,000 local governments. While there appears to
be no need for substantial changes, some amendments to the Act are considered
desirable based upon our experience in administering the general revenue shar-
ing program for the past two- and one-half years.
The draft bill would make such amendments. In addition to extending the
Act through the fiscal year beginning October 1, 1981, the amendments clarify
certain provisions of the Act, require that residents within the recipient govern-
ment's jurisdiction be provided an opportunity to give their views on how
revenue sharing funds should be spent, and facilitate the administration of the
Act from a management point of view. The inflationary impact of this draft
bill has been carefuly considered.
There is also enclosed a section-by-section analysis of the draft bill and a
comparative type showing the changes that would be made in the existing Act.
I urge you to bring this proposed legislation to the attention of the House of
Representatives/Senate at your earliest convenience. An identical draft bill has
been transmitted to the Speaker of the House of Representatives/President of
the Senate.
Sincerely,
NOTE: The letters were addressed to the Honorable
Carl Albert, Speaker of the House of Representa-
GERALD R. FORD
tives, and the Honorable Nelson A. Rockefeller,
President of the Senate.
