Public Papers of the Presidents
I think, would lead to partisan problems that would be much, much worse
than any of the problems we have today, if we have any.
And I must say, in all honesty, Dr. Burns has been very understanding. When
the record of this last year is written, it seems to me that there has been a close
coordination between fiscal and monetary policy which will substantially con-
tribute to the recovery we are talking about the latter part of this year.
1976 PRESIDENTIAL CAMPAIGN
[10.] MR. CRONKITE. Mr. President, speaking of the Presidential term, I
assume nothing has happened in the last few days to change your mind about
