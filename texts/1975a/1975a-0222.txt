ceipts these measures will produce will be refunded to the American people—
refunded in a way that helps correct the distortions in our tax system created by
inflation. Special provisions will ensure that low-income Americans and State
and local governments are compensated equitably. All of these compensatory
measures will be in addition to the $16 billion in tax relief I have proposed.
My budget recommendations provide for total outlays of $349.4 billion in
1976, an increase of $35.9 billion over 1975, and anticipate receipts of $297.5
billion, an increase of $18.8 billion over 1975.
The Congressional Budget and Impoundment Control Act of 1974 provides
for major reforms in the budget process. As part of these reforms, it changes the
fiscal year for the Federal budget from the present July-through-June basis to
an October-through-September basis, beginning with the 1977 fiscal year. This
requires that there be a separate transition quarter, extending from July through
September of 1976, after fiscal year 1976 ends and before fiscal year 1977 begins.
Estimates for the transition quarter are included in this budget. In general, they
anticipate continuing the 1976 program levels unchanged for the additional
three months. Because outlays and receipts vary seasonally—that is, they do not
occur at uniform rates during the year—the estimates for this quarter (and par-
ticularly the deficit) are not representative of a full year's experience.
THE BUDGET AND THE ECONOMY
If the Congress acts decisively on the new policies I have announced in my
State of the Union address, and if we exercise reasonable patience and restraint,
we can go far toward solving the broad range of economic problems our Nation
now faces.
It must be clearly understood that these problems are serious and that strong
remedies are fully justified. The economy is now in a recession. Unemployment
