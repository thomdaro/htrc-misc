FOREWORD
THIS VOLUME represents the 1975 record of my Administration, at home
and abroad-speeches, messages, press conferences and major statements—
documenting a momentous year of achievement.
These collected works demonstrate how the American people, in the first
full year of my Presidency, found a new realism. We crossed the threshold from
recession to restored economic progress, reducing the rate of inflation and
creating a new spirit of self-confidence.
It was in this momentous year that we finally extricated ourselves from war in
Southeast Asia and enjoyed the blessings of peace for the first time in more
than a decade. Americans were finally at peace with the entire world and in
harmony at home.
These documents tell the story of how a new era of national confidence
began to take hold. The mood of our people improved in a manner incon-
ceivable early in the previous year.
It was in this year that I journeyed to the far corners of the earth in search
of peace-to Bonn, Helsinki, Rome, Peking, Manila and other capitals. I am
proud of what our diplomacy achieved in stabilizing the world order, as these
papers attest—in the Sinai withdrawal agreement between Israel and Egypt,
and in other historic achievements. The year 1975 also marked the strengthen-
ing of our ties with the Atlantic Community and Japan.
As America moved toward its third century, we faced new challenges with
new realism. These pages record the continuing American adventure in both
domestic and foreign aspects. They contain the drama of 1975—the momentous
prelude to our 200th anniversary.
