Justice. Also, this program was intended to provide a way for many persons
who received an undesirable discharge from military service for absentee-
related offenses to upgrade their discharge certificate to a clemency discharge.
After reviewing the progress of this program, I believe that many of those
who could benefit from it are only now learning of its application to their cases.
This belief is based on a significant increase in the number of applications and
inquiries over the past few weeks when publicity and communications about
the program were greatly expanded.
Therefore, I am today extending the termination date for applications from
January 31 until March 1, 1975.
NOTE: On the same day, the President signed Proclamation 4345 and Executive Order 11837, extending
the program's application period.

Special Message to the Congress Reporting on Budget
Rescissions and Deferrals.
To the Congress of the United States:
January 30, 1975
I herewith report on additional rescissions and deferrals for fiscal year 1975,
as required by the Congressional Budget and Impoundment Control Act of
1974.
Thirty-five new rescissions and 14 new deferrals are proposed in the amounts
of $1,097 million and $769 million, respectively. In addition, five revised rescis-
sion reports reduce by $178 million the amounts proposed for rescission in
earlier reports, and 12 revised deferral reports increase the amounts reported as
deferred in earlier reports by $111 million.
In the main, the rescissions and deferrals transmitted herein seek to reduce
the increased Federal spending that would otherwise result from four recently-
enacted 1975 appropriation bills—Labor-Health, Education, and Welfare; Agri-
culture-Environmental and Consumer Protection; the First Supplemental; and
the Urgent Supplemental. The 93rd Congress, in the conference report on the
Labor-HEW bill, indicated its willingness “. . . to give full consideration to
such rescissions and deferrals . . .” as might be required to keep 1975 spend-
ing within the total estimate for the bill.
If the Congress does not agree to the rescissions and deferrals accompanying
this message, the 1975 deficit will grow by $357 million and the 1976 deficit by
$675 million. I ask the 94th Congress to give full consideration to the question
