The Proclamation and this legislation would make an equitable distinction
between those who have been required to perform military service and those
who in the future choose to serve in the All-Volunteer Armed Forces. The
termination actions will not affect the eligibility of the millions of Vietnam
veterans already discharged, or those presently serving in the Armed Forces.
I urge the Congress to give prompt and favorable consideration to the draft
bill.
Sincerely,
NOTE: This is the text of identical letters addressed to
the Honorable Carl Albert, Speaker of the House
of Representatives, and the Honorable Nelson A.

Rockefeller, President of the Senate. The text of

Special Message to the Congress Reporting on Budget
Rescissions and Deferrals. May 8, 1975
To the Congress of the United States:
I herewith report one new proposed rescission and one new deferral as re-
quired by the Congressional Budget and Impoundment Control Act of 1974.
In addition, I am transmitting one supplementary report which revises a
deferral report made to the Congress in a previous special message. The details
of the rescission and deferral reports are attached.
The proposed rescission would affect two programs of the Community Serv-
ices Administration that duplicate several programs currently operating at Fed-
eral, State and local levels. The two deferrals are routine in nature and do not
affect program levels in either case.
I urge the Congress to act promptly on this rescission and other rescission
proposals now pending.
The White House,
May 8, 1975.
GERALD R. FORD
NOTE: The attachments detailing the rescissions and deferrals are printed in the Federal Register of
May 16, 1975 (40 FR 21645).
