Gerald R. Ford, 1975
There was an heroic quality about him that marked this man as a crusader
for liberty as well as a man of spiritual contemplation.
His deep faith made him an inspiration not only to the Hungarian people
he served and loved but to all those who value virtue, truth, and strength of will.
Cardinal Mindszenty will be missed. He will not be forgotten.
NOTE: Cardinal Mindszenty was Primate of Hungary from 1945 to 1971.

The President's News Conference of
May 6, 1975
THE PRESIDENT. Good evening. Miss Thomas [Helen Thomas, United Press
International].
VIETNAM CONFLICT
[1.] Q. Mr. President, what are the lessons of Vietnam in terms of the
Presidency, the Congress, and the American people--in terms of secret diplo-
macy and fighting a land war in Asia? And also, would you welcome a Con-
gressional inquiry into how we got in and how we got out of Vietnam?
THE PRESIDENT. Miss Thomas, the war in Vietnam is over. It was sad and
tragic in many respects. I think it would be unfortunate for us to rehash
allegations as to individuals that might be to blame or administrations that
might be at fault.
It seems to me that it's over. We ought to look ahead, and I think a Con-
gressional inquiry at this time would only be divisive, not helpful.
Q. Mr. President, may I ask you, then, don't you think we can learn from the
past?
THE PRESIDENT. Miss Thomas, I think the lessons of the past in Vietnam have
already been learned-learned by Presidents, learned by Congress, learned by
the American people. And we should have our focus on the future. As far as
I'm concerned, that is where we will concentrate.

THE MIDDLE EAST
[2.] Q. Mr. President, your forthcoming meetings with Egyptian President
Sadat and Israeli Prime Minister Rabin-do they represent the beginning of a
new American-led negotiation in the Middle East toward a peace settlement?
