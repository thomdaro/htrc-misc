Public Papers of the Presidents
must have both a short-range and long-range solution to energy problems. And
as anyone knows who has seriously studied the matter and who is honest with
himself, there is no option or alternative available that is free.
I would hope the Congress would give this important matter the very serious
consideration that it deserves and not take hasty action.
I will continue to urge the Congress to accept this reasonable compromise.
If it does not, one alternative to ensure continued progress toward energy in-
dependence would be to veto an extension of the present oil price control law,
which will expire in August.
But the plan I prefer will gradually lift price restrictions on controlled oil
and place a ceiling on all domestic crude oil prices.
We still have the choice of acting in our own best energy interests instead of
reacting to decisions made by foreign countries. We must start thinking of the
energy crisis in terms of American jobs, homes, food, and financial security.
Our economic well-being and our national security depend upon American
control of the American economy. We cannot jeopardize our country's future
by ducking the tough energy choices today. We must pay whatever the price is
that is necessary to give us command of our own economic destiny.
Thank you very much.
REPORTER. Mr. President, did you run into any opposition at the meeting this
morning?
THE PRESIDENT. We had a minimum of opposition. We had a greater under-
standing of the complexity of this problem. It was a very beneficial meeting
in that there was this understanding and recognition that the energy problem
had to be faced very squarely if we were to solve the problem of American
independence and to get our own house in order so that we could protect our-
selves from the vulnerability of foreign oil producers.
Thank you very much.
NOTE: The President spoke at 11:32 a.m. to reporters assembled in the Briefing Room at the White House.
