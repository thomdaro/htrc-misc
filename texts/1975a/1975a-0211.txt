Gerald R. Ford, 1975
term, my proposals will allow our Nation to once again supply a significant
share of the energy needs of the free world.
The legislative program I have proposed will:
(1) encourage early development of our oil, natural gas and coal resources;
(2) help speed the siting and construction of nuclear and other energy
facilities;
(3) reduce energy consumption by mandating thermal standards for new
homes and commercial buildings and assisting persons with low incomes in
winterizing their homes;
(4) encourage investments in the development of new domestic energy
resources;
(5) establish a strategic petroleum reserve to guard against future import
disruptions; and
(6) authorize certain standby authorities to cope with potential embargoes or
energy emergencies.
A more detailed summary of my legislative proposals is enclosed.
My tax proposals already presented by the Secretary of the Treasury would:
(1) place an excise tax of $2 per barrel on all domestic crude oil and an import
fee of $2 on all imported crude oil and petroleum products to help reduce the
demand for oil, promote domestic refining and encourage the development of
new sources of energy;
(2) impose a tax on all domestic crude oil in order to capture windfall profits;
(3) place an excise tax on natural gas equivalent to the $2 tax on oil to reduce
natural gas demand;
(4) provide additional tax credits for public utilities to provide equal tax
treatment with other industries and promote the construction of needed electric
generating facilities;
(5) provide tax credits for homeowners who install additional insulation
to reduce energy consumption;
(6) return to the economy the revenue from energy conservation taxes to
offset higher energy costs, particularly for low and middle income citizens,
and to help restore jobs and production.
The 13 titles of this bill, coupled with appropriate tax measures, are essential
to the eventual attainment of our common goal of energy independence.
Prompt action on all these measures is essential.
I cannot stress too much the sense of urgency I feel about these proposals and
the need for their swift consideration by the Congress as a basis for the earliest
possible enactment into law. Without these measures, we face a future of
