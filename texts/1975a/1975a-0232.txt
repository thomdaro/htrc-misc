HUMAN RESOURCES PROGRAMS.—The rapid growth of human resources pro-
grams in recent years has brought about many improvements in the well-being
of the American people. Benefits under Social Security, Medicare, Medicaid,
Supplemental Security Income, food stamps and veterans programs have in-
creased substantially. In just seven years, cash benefits under social security pro-
grams will have risen from $26 billion in 1969 to $70 billion in 1976. They now
reach 28 million beneficiaries. By 1976, six social security benefit increases will
have occurred since 1969. Automatic cost-of-living adjustments to benefits are
now provided by law. Allowing for the temporary 5% ceiling I have proposed
on benefit increases between now and July 1976, the increases from 1970 through
1976 in the average recipient's social security benefits, taken together, will total
77%. This far exceeds the increases in the cost of living (51%) estimated for
this period.
