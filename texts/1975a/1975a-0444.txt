Public Papers of the Presidents
They may have to go beyond that, depending on certain circumstances, but we
intend to make as full a disclosure as is possible without jeopardizing America's
national security.
REVENUE SHARING
[16.] Q. Mr. President, tonight you are meeting with several Midwestern
Governors. In light of some sagging revenues at State and local levels and your
own budget tightening, what can you tell them about your long-range plans for
return of the Federal dollar both to State and municipalities-revenue sharing
and this type of thing?
THE PRESIDENT. In my State of the Union Message and in the Budget Mes-

for the first year of the extended program is close to $7 billion a year, which is

present program.
It is a very, I think, generous proposal. It does crank in the inflation factor.
And if the Congress goes along, I think it will be materially beneficial to the
States and local units of government.

tax?
THE PRESIDENT. Well, I could not help but notice over the weekend 102
Democrats joined in a statement in the House of Representatives condemning
a gasoline tax.
I think a gasoline tax of the magnitude that several have proposed is not the
right approach, and I do not think the Congress will approve it. I think the
energy crisisâ€”the energy program can be best implemented by the proposal I
submitted in January. And I hope that in the negotiations between Mr. Zarb
