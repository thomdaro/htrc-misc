National will comes from a consensus of national purpose, from the collec-
tive agreement among thinking citizens as to the goals they seek as a nation.
A free people will never find unanimity, but a people must be united in the
pursuit of certain common goals in order to remain free.
The goals that were proclaimed here in Philadelphia, after a dozen years of
war and wrestling with the problems of a new kind of self-government society,
are as valid today as they were in 1787: to form a more perfect Union, establish
justice, ensure domestic tranquillity, provide for the common defense, promote

Yes, we are coming out of this recession. We are on our way back. And we are
on the right track. We cannot be satisfied with simply getting back to where
