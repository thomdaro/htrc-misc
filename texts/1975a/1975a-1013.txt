July 3

Gerald R. Ford, 1975
together we can bring forth rich, new harvests from this great land of oppor-
tunity. We can invite all Americans, whatever their race, sex, or station in life,
to sit at the table of America's bounty and partake more fully of its great
abundance.
I truly see America's future as bright with hope and promise. I see a nation
that works.
I see people taking pride in their work and their lives. I see a national gov-
ernment that responds to people's needs, but does not order people's lives. And
don't forget that a government big enough to give you everything you want
is a government big enough to take from you everything you have.
I see a reemergence of old values, values like simple honesty and common de-
cency, as new natural resources with which to build a nobler, safer, and more
successful society.
There is no reason, as I see it, in the world today why we can't live the kind
of a life we want: a life of optimism and faith, a life of close kinship and good
relations with our neighbors, a life with room for joy, a life of peace with our-
selves and with those about us.
I believe and, as I look around this great room tonight, I think you believe,
in America. I believe in the American people, as you do, and I believe that as
we start our third century of independence, we can take renewed confidence in
our future, a future that calls us-every one of usâ€”to new achievement and
glory and greatness.
Thank you very much.
NOTE: The President spoke at 7:52 p.m. in the Grand
Ballroom at the Cleveland Sheraton Hotel. In his
opening remarks, he referred to John Dwyer, chair-
man of the Cuyahoga County Republican Executive
Committee, and Ray Bliss, former national chairman
of the Republican Party.
