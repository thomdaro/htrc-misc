Message to the Congress Transmitting Annual Report on
Coastal Zone Management. May 22, 1975
To the Congress of the United States:
I am transmitting herewith the second annual report prepared by the Sec-
retary of Commerce dealing with the first year of actual operation under the
Coastal Zone Management Act of 1972. The report covers Fiscal Year 1974
during which time the initial funding for the program became available.
With the critical need to increase our domestic supplies of energy and other
resources from the areas off our coasts, a high priority is attached to the neces-
sity of carrying out these activities in a safe and orderly manner. For many
States and localities, the existence of the coastal zone management program
provides a means for assessing and preparing for the effects of new or increased
developmental activity in their coastal areas.
This program also seeks to establish a partnership between the States and the
Federal government in managing our coastal resources in a way that balances
development and environmental concerns.
The White House,
May 22, 1975.
NOTE: The report is entitled "Report to the Con-
gress on Coastal Zone Management-July 1973
GERALD R. FORD
through June 1974" (Government Printing Office,
30 pp. plus appendixes).

Remarks at a Reception for Former Members of Congress.
May 22, 1975
I THINK you all realize that it is a great privilege and pleasure for me to get
together on this fifth annual alumni gathering of the former Members of
Congress.
I do hope that you have all had an enjoyable 2 days, and I hope that this final
event will be an appropriate ending to this period of time that you have gotten
together.
I can't help but say that this is one organization whose members have really
made it. Most of you can sleep late each morning, get up when you feel like it,
listen to the birds sing, linger over your coffee, spend 2 hours reading the news-
