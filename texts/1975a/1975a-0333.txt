Dear Mr. President:
Permit me to submit my resignation as Counsel

I am grateful for the opportunity you have given
me to serve the country once more. But now that I
have done all that I can as Counsel to help in
establishing your Administration, I have satisfied
my commitment in coming to the White House last
Fall. I plan therefore to return to my teaching and
scholarship at Harvard.

I shall be honored to render any occasional future
assistance that you might find useful after my
return to Cambridge in several weeks. I leave behind

Statement on the Death of Representative Jerry L. Pettis
of California. February 14, 1975
MRS. FORD and I were deeply grieved to learn of the plane crash that took the
life of our old friend, Representative Jerry Pettis.
Jerry Pettis was more than just a Member of the House of Representatives.
He also excelled as a rancher, teacher, aviator, religious leader, and businessman.
Jerry brought the insights he gained in these varied fields to his work in the
Congress and his position of leadership among House Republicans.
It was my great privilege and pleasure to work closely with Jerry for 8 yearsâ€”
first as a colleague in the House, and then as President. I will miss his loyal
support and wise counsel.
Mrs. Ford and I extend our deepest sympathy to his wife, Shirley, and to his
family.
NOTE: Representative Pettis was a Member of Congress from 1967 until his death on February 14, 1975.
