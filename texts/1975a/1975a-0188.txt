Message to the Congress Transmitting Final Report of
Activities Under the Uniform Relocation Assistance
and Real Property Acquisition Policies Act of 1970.
January 27, 1975
To the Congress of the United States:
I am transmitting today the fourth and final annual report of each executive
department and agency on its activities during Fiscal Year 1974 in the admin-
istration of the Uniform Relocation Assistance and Real Property Acquisition
Policies Act of 1970.
Federal agencies report that the effects of implementation of the Uniform
Act have generally been extremely beneficial for displaced families and in-
dividuals. The replacement housing payment available to displaced homeowners
and tenants in addition to a payment for moving expenses, have greatly en-
hanced the rehousing options of displaced persons. The relocation assistance
program of the agencies has been instrumental in assisting those displaced to
improve the quality of their housing and standard of living and in assisting
many tenants to become homeowners. The Uniform Act's program and policies
are being favorably received by those persons displaced and communities
affected by Federal and federally assisted projects.
The Administrator of General Services, who has responsibility for executive
branch leadership in the implementation of the Uniform Act, has recently
reported to me concerning accomplishments under this program and plans to
further improve the administration of the Act. I endorse these efforts and
include his report as an enclosure to this transmittal.
The White House,
January 27, 1975.
