Special Message to the Congress Reporting on Budget
Rescissions and Deferrals. July 1, 1975
To the Congress of the United States:
I herewith propose three rescissions and report twenty-seven deferrals in
accordance with the Impoundment Control Act of 1974. The rescission pro-
posals total $123.7 million and the deferrals total $2,729.4 million for a total of
$2,853.0 million in fiscal year 1976 budget authority.
Funds for two highway programs, one duplicating an existing system and one
that could be funded through Federal-aid highway funds now available to the
States, are proposed for rescission. The third rescission proposal reflects a recent
Congressionally-approved change in program needs by requesting reduced fund-
ing for the Federal Law Enforcement Training Center. The deferrals are pri-
marily routine in nature and do not affect program levels. The details of each
rescission proposal and deferral are contained in the attached reports.
I urge the Congress to act promptly on the proposed rescissions.
The White House,
July 1, 1975.
GERALD R. FORD
NOTE: The attachments detailing the rescissions and deferrals are printed in the Federal Register of July 9,
1975 (40 FR 29001).

Northern Mariana Islands in Political Union with the United States of America."
On June 17, 1975, the people of the Northern Mariana Islands of the Trust
Territory of the Pacific Islands overwhelmingly approved the Covenant in a
United Nations-observed plebiscite. This historic act of self-determination was
the capstone of more than twenty years of continuous effort on the part of the
