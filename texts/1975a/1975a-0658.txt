Message to the Congress Reporting on United States
Trade With Romania. April 24, 1975
To the Congress of the United States:
Pursuant to Section 402(c)(1) of the Trade Act of 1974, I shall issue today
an Executive Order [11854] waiving the application of subsections (a) and (b)
of Section 402 of the Trade Act of 1974 with respect to the Socialist Republic of
Romania, and I am hereby making the report contemplated by Section 402 (c)
(1) of the Act.
I refer to the Declaration of the Presidents of the United States and of the
Socialist Republic of Romania signed in Washington in 1973¹ wherein it was
stated that “they will contribute to the solution of humanitarian problems on
the basis of mutual confidence and good will.” I have been assured that if and
when such problems arise they will be solved, on a reciprocal basis, in the spirit
of that Declaration. Accordingly, I am convinced that the emigration practices
of Romania will lead substantially to the achievement of the objectives of
Section 402 of the Act. I have therefore determined that the waiver contained
in said Executive Order will substantially promote the objectives of Section 402
of the Act.
The White House,
April 24, 1975.

Remarks to Participants in the Annual Conference of
the Advertising Council. April 24, 1975
Chairman McCabe, President Keim, members of the Cabinet, members of the
Advertising Council:
At the outset, let me, on behalf of Betty as well as myself, extend to all of you
a very warm welcome here to the East Room. I know from past experience,
when I was up on Capitol Hill, that when the Advertising Council came to
Washington, you had an impact, an impact on me and all the other Members
of the Congress with whom you would meet.
