be extracted from the U.S. balance of payments accounting system. I will provide
details on these offset categories in my May 1975 report to the Congress.
Once our analysis has been completed and the FY 74 military balance of pay-
ments deficit has been established, I am confident that this deficit will be offset
by the items we have identified and that the requirements of Section 812 will
be met.

Toast at a Dinner Honoring the Nation's Governors.
February 20, 1975
Our distinguished Governors, your lovely wives, and our other very distin-
guished guests:
It is obviously a very great privilege and pleasure for Betty and myself to
have you here with us this evening.
And may I propose a toast to our honored guests, the distinguished Americans
who are here tonight, who provide the dedication, the imagination, the motiva-
tion, and the firm direction that all good government requires. And may I also
propose a second toast to your husbands as well. [Laughter] We have got one
exception, though.ยน
Betty and I do wish to welcome you in our home. Well, we really don't own
it. Let's say we have a rather uncertain lease. And while there has been a great
deal of speculation as to when it might become vacant, I have to tell you one
thing: Betty hates to move.
We do appreciate the honor of your visit, and as a small souvenir, it's my
understanding Betty would like the ladies to have this first edition of a very
special scarf she has designed with Frankie Welch over in Alexandria. I believe
you found them on your chairs as you came in. Betty and I hope that even in
the chilliest of days ahead they will prove, or provide you, I should say, with
the warm memories of this particular evening.
This is our first formal dinner for all the Governors, and I hope it symbolizes

1975.
