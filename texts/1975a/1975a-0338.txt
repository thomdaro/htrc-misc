Statement on the Death of Raymond Moley.
February 19, 1975
FOR NEARLY half a century, Raymond Moley was one of the most perceptive
and penetrating minds on the American political scene. As a writer and adviser
to Presidents and as an author, editor, and columnist, Mr. Moley knew Washing-
ton as few other men have, going back to the early days of Franklin Roosevelt's
administration.
Mr. Moley was also a scholarâ€”a man of reflection as well as action-and his
sense of balance and historical perspective led him to oppose political extremes
in either direction. In his long and active life, he excelled both as a practitioner

Mrs. Ford and I extend our sympathy to Mrs. Moley and the Moley family
on the loss of this distinguished American.
NOTE: Mr. Moley was a contributing editor of Newsweek magazine from 1937 to 1968.

than narrow interests. I will continue to work with Congress to this end.
I intend to veto this legislation. I could not do otherwise and be faithful to my
oath of office. I deeply believe a prompt solution to our energy problems is
