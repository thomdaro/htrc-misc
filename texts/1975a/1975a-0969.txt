Letter to the Speaker of the House and the President of the
Senate Transmitting Proposed Legislation To Increase
Enriched Uranium Production. June 26, 1975
I HAVE today sent to the Congress a message describing my plan for securing
the construction of additional uranium enrichment plants in the United States
by private industry to meet the growing needs of the expanding nuclear power
industry.
A critical element of this plan is legislation to authorize the Administrator of
the Energy Research and Development Administration to enter into coopera-
tive agreements with private firms to foster, through Government cooperation
and temporary assurances, the creation of a competitive private uranium en-
richment industry. I am enclosing a proposed bill, the Nuclear Fuel Assurance
Act of 1975, which would provide the authority needed to achieve the objectives
described in my message. A brief analysis of the bill is also enclosed.
I urge the Congress to pass this legislation at the earliest possible date so that
we can take a major step toward our goal of energy independence.
Sincerely,
NOTE: This is the text of identical letters addressed
to the Honorable Carl Albert, Speaker of the House
of Representatives, and the Honorable Nelson A.
