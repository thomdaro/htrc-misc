Letter Accepting the Resignation of Deputy Attorney General
Laurence H. Silberman. March 12, 1975
Dear Larry:
I have your letter of February 21, and it is with deepest regret that I accept your
resignation as Deputy Attorney General, effective upon the appointment and
qualification of your successor, as you requested.
In doing so, I want to take this opportunity to express my personal appreciation
for your dedicated service to our Nation and to my Administration. Through-
out your career in government, you have brought to each of your many challeng-
ing responsibilities great energy, skill and high professional integrity. I have had
many occasions, particularly during this past difficult period of transition, to
admire these qualities and to seek your valued counsel. Your devotion to the
proper administration of justice throughout our land, and your significant con-
tributions to the operations of the Department of Justice have earned the grati-
tude of all your fellow citizens and my own deep respect.
Betty joins me in extending to Ricki and you our warmest good wishes for
the future.
Sincerely,
[The Honorable Laurence H. Silberman, Deputy Attorney General, Washington, D.C.]
