agreement that satisfied all parties. Four
protocols were elaborated into final,
agreed form, detailing such key military
provisions as ceasefire supervision and re-
lease of prisoners. In short, we had
achieved essentially all that we had set out
to do on October 26.
Simultaneously, we continued consulta-
tions with the South Vietnamese Govern-
ment, and these moved to a successful
conclusion. On many questions we had
improved the agreement to our ally's satis-
faction; on others, the South Vietnamese
changed their positions for the sake of
concluding the settlement.
On January 23, 1973, Dr. Kissinger re-
turned to Paris for a final meeting. On
that date the United States and North
Vietnam, with the concurrence of their
allies, initialled the agreement.
That evening in announcing the settle-
ment, I said:
"We must recognize that ending the
war is only the first step toward building
the peace. All parties must now see to it
that this is a peace that lasts, and also a
peace that heals, and a peace that not
only ends the war in Southeast Asia, but
contributes to the prospects of peace
the whole world."

In Paris, on January 27, 1973â€”the first
anniversary of the comprehensive U.S.-
GVN peace plan-Secretary of State
Rogers signed the agreement for the
United States.

ditions that we had laid down on Janu-
