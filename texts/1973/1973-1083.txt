378 Statement About Signing Six Bills Authorizing Disposal
of National Stockpile Materials. December 31, 1973
I HAVE signed six bills (S. 2413, S. 2316,
S. 2498, S. 2551, S. 2493, and S. 2166),
which will give the General Services Ad-
ministration the authority to sell approxi-
mately $900 million of aluminum, copper,
zinc, molybdenum, silicon carbide, and
opium which are currently stockpiled by
the Federal Government but which are no
longer needed for national defense
purposes.
The Congress, and particularly the
Armed Services Committees, deserve ap-
preciation and commendation for their
constructive review of the supply and de-
mand factors which make these disposals
possible without detriment to our national
security interests.
In order to facilitate a timely review of
other unneeded materials which have been
proposed for disposal, I am requesting the
General Services Administration to pro-
vide the Congress with data on them
comparable to the information presented
in connection with the disposal bills I have
signed into law.
NOTE: The bills, approved on December 28,
1973, were:
