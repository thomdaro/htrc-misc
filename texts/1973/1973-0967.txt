and finite financial burden on the tax-
payer. As I stated in my message to the
Congress on national legislative goals on
September 10, I simply could not sign any
legislation which purported to solve this
problem through massive, open-ended
subsidies or through quasi-nationalization.
As we work with the Congress to strength-
en the new Amtrak Improvement Act, the
Administration will also continue cooper-
ating fully in helping to produce a sound,
acceptable bill to assist the bankrupt
Northeast-Midwest railroads.
NOTE: As enacted, S. 2016 is Public Law 93-

321 Message to the Congress Transmitting Report on the
Hudson River Basin Compact Act. November 6, 1973
To the Congress of the United States:
In accordance with section 3 of Public
Law 89-605, as amended by Public Law
91-242, I am transmitting a report by the
Secretary of the Interior. This report rec-
ommends discontinuance of negotiations
for a Federal-Interstate Compact and
suggests repeal by Congress of Public Law
89-605 as amended by Public Law 91-
242, the Hudson River Basin Compact
Act.
The report includes a letter of agree-
ment signed by the Secretary of the In-
terior and the Governors of New Jersey
and New York. This letter documents the
agreement reached and explains the facts
leading to the agreement.
I concur in the recommendations of the
Secretary of the Interior. A draft bill re-
pealing Public Law 89-605 as amended
by Public Law 91-242 is enclosed for your
consideration.

322 White House Statement About House Action
Overriding the War Powers Resolution Veto.
November 7, 1973
THE PRESIDENT is extremely disap-
pointed with the House vote to override
his veto of House Joint Resolution 542.
He feels the action seriously undermines
this Nation's ability to act decisively and
convincingly in times of international
crisis.
The confidence of our allies in our
ability to assist them will be diminished by
the House's action. Our potential adver-
saries may be encouraged to engage in
future acts of international mischief be-
cause of this blow to our deterrent posture.
