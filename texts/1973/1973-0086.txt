Public Papers of the Presidents
before the Congress approves any spend-
ing bill, it establish a rigid ceiling on
spending, limiting total 1974 outlays to
the $268.7 billion recommended in this
budget.
I do not believe the American people
want higher taxes any more than they
want inflation. I am proposing to avoid
both higher taxes and inflation by hold-
ing spending in 1974 and 1975 to no
more than revenues would be at full
employment.
1975 PROJECTIONS IN THE 1974
BUDGET
This year's budget presents, for the first
time, a detailed preview of next year's.
I have taken this step to demonstrate that
if we stay within the 1974 and 1975 esti-
mated outlays presented in this budget,
we will prevent a tax increase--and that
the 1974 budget is a sound program for
the longer range future, not simply for
today. This innovation in budget presen-
tation is a blueprint for avoiding infla-
tion and tax increases, while framing
more responsive instruments of govern-
ment and maintaining prosperity.
Our ability to carry out sound fiscal
policy and to provide the resources needed
to meet emerging problems has been lim-
ited by past decisions. In 1974. $202 bil-
lion in outlays, or 75% of the budget, is
virtually uncontrollable due to existing
law and prior-year commitments. But just
as every budget is heavily influenced by
those that have preceded it, so it strongly
influences those that follow.
Control over the budget can be im-
proved by projecting future available re-
sources and the known claims on them,
and then making current decisions within
the constraints they impose. That is why,
in my first budget, I began the practice of
showing projections of future total reve-
nues and outlays under current and pro-
posed legislation. In the 1973 budget,
5-year projections of the cost of legisla-
tive proposals for major new and ex-
panded programs were added.
This budget presents an even closer
look at the implications of the 1974 pro-
posals for the 1975 budget. It projects, in
agency and functional detail, the outlays
in 1975 that will result from the major
program proposals in the 1974 budget,
including the outlay savings that can be
realized from program reductions in 1973
and 1974. In so doing, it takes into con-
sideration the longer range effect of each
of our fiscal actions.
Most importantly, this budget shows the
narrow margin between projected out-
lays and full-employment revenues in
1975, despite the economy measures that
are recommended. Program reductions
and terminations of the scale proposed
are clearly necessary if we are to keep
control of fiscal policy in the future.
The 1974 budget program implies
1975 full-employment outlays of about
$288 billion, $19 billion 7 more than
in 1974. This is within our estimate of full-
employment revenues of $290 billion for
1975. There is, however, very little room
for the creation of new programs requiring
additional outlays in 1975 and no room
for the postponement of the reductions
and terminations proposed in this budget.
The program reductions and termina-
tions I have proposed will result in more
significant savings in 1975 and later years
than in 1973 and 1974. It is for this rea-
son, too, that I have included the 1975
projections in my budget this year. The
Federal spending pipeline is a very long
one in most cases, and the sooner we start
