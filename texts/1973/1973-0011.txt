PREFACE
IN THIS VOLUME are gathered most of the public messages
and statements of the 37th President of the United States that
were released by the White House in 1973. Similar volumes are
available covering the Administrations of Presidents Truman,
Eisenhower, Kennedy, and Johnson.
The series was begun in 1957 in response to a recommendation
of the National Historical Publications Commission. Until then
there had been no systematic publication of Presidential papers.
An extensive compilation of the messages and papers of the
Presidents, covering the period 1789 to 1897, was assembled by
James D. Richardson and published under Congressional author-
ity between 1896 and 1899. Since then various private compilations
have been issued, but there was no uniform publication compara-
ble to the Congressional Record or the United States Supreme
Court Reports. Many Presidential papers could be found only
in mimeographed White House releases or as reported in the
press. The National Historical Publications Commission therefore
recommended the establishment of an official series in which
Presidential writings and utterances of a public nature could be
made promptly available.
The Commission's recommendation was incorporated in regu-
lations of the Administrative Committee of the Federal Register
issued under section 6 of the Federal Register Act (44 U.S.C.
1506). The Committee's regulations, establishing the series and
providing for the coverage of prior years, are reprinted as
Appendix E.
CONTENT AND ARRANGEMENT
The text of this book is based on Presidential materials issued
during the period as White House releases and on transcripts of
news conferences. Original source materials, where available,
including tape recordings, have been used to protect against errors
in transcription.
