war. This is the result of changing assess-
ments of security requirements, our suc-
cess in developing allied capabilities, and
the increasing costs of replacing obso-
lescent systems and maintaining existing
forces.
Our ground, naval, and air forces have
now reached the absolute minimum neces-
sary to meet our commitments and pro-
vide a credible conventional deterrent in
an age of strategic parity. Compared to
levels in June 1964, we have a third fewer
combat ships, 37 fewer aircraft squadrons
and 33 fewer ground. divisions.
Manpower has been cut to a com-
parable degree. In the last four years we
have reduced our forces by more than a
million men. They are now one-third
smaller. They are at the lowest level since
the Korean War, and are nearly half a
million below levels prior to the Vietnam
War.
About one-third of our general purpose
forces are necessarily deployed abroad to
provide a capability for responding
rapidly to threats to American and allied
interests, for guaranteeing the credibility
of our joint defense, and for underpinning
our diplomacy. The forces remaining in
the United States serve as a ready reserve
for reinforcing our forward deployments,
and for protecting our interests in other
parts of the world. The largest portion of
our overseas forces is stationed in Western
Europe; a smaller increment is stationed
in the Mediterranean and Asia.
