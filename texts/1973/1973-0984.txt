Public Papers of the Presidents
diary files, I have located a dictation belt
that I dictated at 8:30 p.m. on June 20,
1972, on which, among other activities of
the day, I referred to a telephone call with
John Mitchell. The portion of the belt
relating to the conversation with John
Mitchell will be submitted to the court.
We have also located the dictation belt
of my recollections of the conversations
in question for March 21, 1973, and the
relevant portions of these recollections to-
gether with the actual recordings of the
conversations, of course, will also be sub-
mitted to the court in compliance with its
order.
Over the weekend of November 4 and
5, 1973, upon checking my personal diary
file for April 15, 1973, to locate informa-
tion to be produced in accordance with the
court's order, I found that my file for that
day consists of personal notes of the con-
versation held with John Dean the eve-
ning of April 15, 1973, but not a dictation
belt. My original handwritten notes, made
during my meeting with John Dean on the
evening of April 15, 1973, will be submit-
ted to the court.
On June 11, 1973, the Special Prosecu-
tor requested a tape of a conversation I
had with John Dean on April 15, 1973
(which I had previously offered to let As-
sistant Attorney General Petersen hear).
As has been pointed out, my personal
diary file consists of notes of conversations
and dictation belts of recollections, and I
believed in June that I had dictated my
recollections of April 15, 1973, of conver-
sations which occurred on that day. The
response to the Special Prosecutor made
on June 16, 1973, referred to such a dic-
tation belt. At that time, however, I did
not review my file to confirm that it con-
tained the belt.
I have made a diligent search for other
evidentiary materials that might shed light
on the substance of my conversation with
John Dean on the evening of April 15,
1973. Other than my contemporaneous
notes of that meeting mentioned above, I
have found no such evidence. However,
I did meet with John Dean on Monday,
April 16, 1973, on two occasions. The first
was in the morning in the Oval Office; the
second was in the afternoon in the Exec-
utive Office Building office. This was my
final meeting with Mr. Dean before he
left the White House Staff. Both of these
conversations were recorded on the White
House recording system. I recently re-
viewed the recordings of these conversa-
tions. A comparison of my notes of the
April 15, 1973, meeting and the record-
ing of the conversation with Mr. Dean
on the morning of April 16, 1973, shows
both conversations covered much the same
subject matter. There are references
throughout the conversation on the morn-
ing of April 16 to the conversation held
the evening before.
I shall voluntarily submit to the court,
under the procedures applicable to record-
ings of conversations already covered by
the court order, these recordings of my two
conversations with John Dean on April 16,
1973-
In addition, as stated above and con-
sistent with the court order, the court will
be provided with:
(1) The portion of the dictation belt
containing my recollection of the
June 20, 1972, conversation with
Mr. Mitchell.
(2) The portion of the dictation belt
of my recollections of the meetings
with Mr. Dean on March 21, 1973-
(3) Contemporaneous notes from the
