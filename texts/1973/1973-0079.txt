nations whose citizens came to this coun-
try are part of the American heritage. The
richness and diversity that characterize the
whole of art in the United States reflect
both our history and the promise of our
future.
I invite every Member of Congress to
share my pleasure at the many fine
achievements of the National Council on
the Arts and the National Endowment for
the Arts. And I urge the Congress to con-
tinue to make available to the Endow-
ment the resources it needs to fulfill its
hopeful task of bringing a more vital life
to our Nation.

16 Message to the Congress Transmitting Reports on the
Military Incentive Awards Program. January 26, 1973
To the Congress of the United States:
Recognizing that our military forces
must always maintain a high degree of
preparedness, the Congress in 1965 au-
thorized a cash incentive program to re-
ward military personnel for imaginative
suggestions, inventions and scientific
achievements.
Today I am pleased to forward to the
Congress the reports of the Secretary of
Defense and the Secretary of Transporta-
tion on cash awards made during fiscal
year 1972. Tangible benefits resulting from
suggestions submitted by military per-
sonnel that were adopted during that year
totalled more than $107 million, bring-
ing the total first-year savings for tax-
payers from this worthwhile program to
$661 million.
Of the 157,195 suggestions which were
submitted by military personnel during
the reporting period, 24,580 were adopted.
Cash awards totalling $1,822,762 were
paid for these adopted suggestions. En-
listed personnel received $1,502,660 in
awards, representing 82 percent of the
total cash awards paid. The remaining
18 percent was received by officer per-
sonnel and amounted to $320, 102.
The reports of the Secretary of Defense
and the Secretary of Transportation con-
tain more detailed statistical information
on the military awards program and also
include a few brief descriptions of some
of the better ideas of our military person-
nel during fiscal year 1972. For example,
two Air Force sergeants were awarded a
total of $25,000 for suggesting a modifica-
tion to the F-105 weapons control system.
Their new idea improved the combat
capability of the aircraft, enhanced the
safety of aircrews in the Southeast Asia
Theater of operations and saved more
than $25 million of the taxpayers' money
in the first year.
I commend these reports to the atten-
tion of the Congress.
The White House,
January 26, 1973.
