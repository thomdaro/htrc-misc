-Manpower, of course, is a common
denominator to all the forces in Cen-
tral Europe. In large forces however,
reducing manpower may not neces-
sarily be the only important aspect.
If manpower is reduced, what be-
comes of the equipment? Should it
be destroyed or reassembled in depots
for continuing surveillance?
-Small reductions of manpower can-
not be verified except under well-de-
fined and stringent circumstances;
demobilization of national forces on
their own territory is particularly dif-
ficult to monitor except in very large
numbers.
-The forces in Central Europe are
both indigenous and "foreign" but
this is a political as well as a military
distinction. Should all forces be
treated equally? If so, what compen-
sation is necessary for the fact that
the United States would withdraw its
forces across the Atlantic, while the
Soviet Union would withdraw only
several hundred miles?
-Following actual reductions, control
on the reintroduction of forces into
the area for maneuvers or for re-
placements needs to be considered
along with related verification
requirements.
-How quickly each side could restore
its forces to a pre-reduction level
through mobilization and reinforce-
ment becomes a significant factor.
Compensation for advantages that
one side may have should be
considered.
As in SALT, the analysis of such ques-
tions provides us with the building blocks
which can be put together in different
ways to help us understand the implica-
tions of different reduction processes:
-Proportionately equal reductions.
Each side would apply a common
percentage to reduce its forces. This
appears to be a simple but equitable
approach. If applied to all forces,
however, it could create an imbal-
ance because it would favor the
offense and because of the geo-
graphical advantages of the Warsaw
Pact.
-Reductions to equal levels. This
would in effect produce a common
ceiling for Central Europe. There
would be some unequal cuts in ab-
solute numbers, but the residual ca-
pabilities would be more balanced
and offensive potential would thereby
be reduced.
-Mixed,
asymmetrical
reductions.
This means reductions would be
made by different amounts in various
categories of weapons or manpower.
It could prove extremely complex to
define equivalence between different
weapons systems.
We have now completed our technical
evaluation. We understand the major is-
sues related to actual reductions and
which approaches are realistic. We have
shared the results of our studies with our
NATO allies and have contributed to
studies within the Alliance.
Allied Consultations. We now enter the
final and most important stage in building
an Alliance position. In addition to the
completion of technical studies and diplo-
matic plans, we face one basic question:
what security concept will the Alliance
follow in developing its position for the
negotiations next fall?
The Alliance is committed to "undi-
minished security" in the MBFR process,
but we must agree on what this means in
concrete terms. Different political view-
