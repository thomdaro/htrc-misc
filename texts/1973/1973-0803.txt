And they are, I hope, going to give me a
statement that I can make at the opening
of the trade negotiations next week, on
their expectations about getting the bill
through.
THE PRESIDENT. You might want to
question the Secretary tomorrow on the
trade bill and its various problems.
REPORTER. Mr. President, when you
spoke of a dramatic drop, did you mean
a dramatic drop in the price of corn and
soybeans?
THE PRESIDENT. What we call futures.
Here is a little preview to the press con-
ference.
SECRETARY SHULTZ. Here is the aver-
age price for soybeans per bushel in the
period August 13 to 17.
THE PRESIDENT. That is the figure that
is going to come out tomorrow and scare
everybody to death.
SECRETARY SHULTZ. I don't know what
has happened today. Yesterday, the cash
price for soybeans was $7, so that is a de-
crease of $3.26, or about 32 percent.
THE PRESIDENT. Over a period of 2
weeks.
SECRETARY SHULTZ. When you look at a
chart of this, it is really pretty interesting.
The price went way up, and now it has
come down. The following month, assum-
ing the prices stay around this level, we
will see a big decrease. But in the farm
area, the prices are very volatile. They go
up and down a lot.
THE PRESIDENT. Except lately they
have been going up.
soy-
SECRETARY SHULTZ. Yes, that is right.
THE PRESIDENT. However, on both
beans and corn, one of the factors that
has been helpful has been the very con-
siderable increase in production, and also
a somewhat lessening demand-Herb, you
pointed that out this morning to the
leaders-abroad, somewhat; isn't that
true?
MR. STEIN. Well, the export demand
doesn't seem to be quite as big as had been
expected.
THE PRESIDENT. That is right. It is less
than our expectations, although still big.
Don't feel sorry for the farmers. They are
doing very, very well in spite of this, right?
$2.20 corn, you make plenty of money.
They won't make as much as they want,
but they will make a lot, right?
MR. STEIN. Right.
THE PRESIDENT. And $7 soybeans, you
don't lose any money on that, do you? I
don't even know what a soybean is.
[Laughter]
REPORTER. Are these August figures,
and then you will project for the future?
THE PRESIDENT. Yes, you see the fig-
ures come out tomorrow.
SECRETARY SHULTZ. I won't give them
out. They will be released by the Depart-
ment of Labor.
THE PRESIDENT. He will interpret
them.
SECRETARY SHULTZ. People have been
able to calculate what this index is likely
to show fairly well.
REPORTER. What were those prices for,
Mr. Secretary, wholesale?
SECRETARY SHULTZ. Well, there are
prices in the wholesale market, there is a
cash price here on this table. There is a
September price, and there is a November
price, and I was looking at the cash price
and you can see it here.
THE PRESIDENT. Let me keep it all in
context by saying that this report, that is
somewhat encouraging, does in no way
change our attitude toward the urgency
of the problem. The problem of rising
food costs is still with us and will continue
to be with us, but it does indicate that our
