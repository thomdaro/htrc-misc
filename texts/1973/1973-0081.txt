19 Remarks Introducing Members of the National League
of Families of American Prisoners and Missing in
Southeast Asia to the Bipartisan Congressional
Leadership. January 26,
GENTLEMEN, if I may take just a
moment of your time, I would like to in-
troduce you to these visitors. I stepped
out of the room because they were meet-
ing in the Roosevelt Room with Dr.
Kissinger.
Over the past 4 years, approximately
every month we have met with the leaders
of the organization of the American lea-
gue of families which represents our
POW's and our MIA's in all of Indo-
china. They have been long meetings, and
we have not in times past been able to
do much but to tell them we have tried
hard and that we hope for the best and
we are praying for the best.
Today we were able to meet in an en-
tirely different atmosphere than had ever
been the case previously.
I would like to tell you where they are
from, because it should be of interest to
you.
Mrs. Sadler is from the State of Texas,
and her husband is a MIA.
Mrs. Knapp is from Colorado, and her
husband is a MIA.
1973
Mrs. Galanti is now the president of
the group, and her husband is a POW.
PHYLLIS GALANTI. I am from Virginia.
THE PRESIDENT. And you are from
Virginia.
I want you to know that when I made
my brief talk to the Nation the other day,
I pointed out that there were and I
understand the attitudes of those who felt
this way that we were perhaps too in-
sistent on peace with honor. But I can say
there was no group in America who had
a greater stake in ending the war as
quickly as possible, without regard to how
it was ended.
But the reason that I said these are
some of the bravest people America has
ever produced is that they never wavered.
They always said, "We want our men
back, but we also want peace with honor
for what they fought for."
That is what they are.
We thank you.
NOTE: The President spoke at 11:12 a.m. in
the Cabinet Room at the White House.
