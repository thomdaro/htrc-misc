THESE ARE the papers for the first year of my second term as
Presidentâ€”a term that was not to be completed. The scholars and

in Vietnam, and our prisoners of war would at last be returned
to us.
At home, we began the second Administration with a still more
vigorous attempt to reorganize the unwieldy Federal government.
We tried to make the Executive Branch more efficient and func-

1973. Since the corollary of a more responsible and responsive
