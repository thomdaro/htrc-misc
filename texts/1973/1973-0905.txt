Richard Nixon, 1973
Oct. 9 [288]
after she was able to take a trip to Africa,
which I have been wanting to take and I,
incidentally, Dr. Kissinger, intend to take
before my term of office is finished-the
first American President ever to visit
Africa-Mrs. Nixon came back with very
warm feelings for all the countries she had
visited, but she had a very special feeling
about Ivory Coast, and its President and
its First Lady.
She said that the President was a man
who not only was handling the affairs of
his country well but who had a great grasp
of the problems of the world. And she said
that his First Lady was, among all the
first ladies she had met in the world, one
of the most gracious, the most beautiful
and-to a woman this is important, and
to a man also-the best dressed.
Now, to be very serious for a moment,
before introducing the President to this
assemblage, people wonder what hap-
pens when the President of Ivory Coast
and the President of the United States
sit down for an hour and a half and talk.
Now, we both agree that we talked about
cocoa and coffee and reverse preferences
and international trade problems, and
other bilateral matters, like whether
Kaiser should or should not invest in Ivory
Coast-and they should-but what, it
seems to me, is particularly important
about this visit is that while we covered
all the bilateral problems very thoroughly
and found that we had very little to dis-
agree about, that the President was able
to convey to me an understanding of not
only the problems of his own country and
the problems of the new African states
but an understanding of his view of the
world.
In other words, we have in our com-
pany tonight-and I wish all of you could
know him as I have known him, as my
wife has known him-a world statesman
of the first rank, a man who has demon-
strated by his leadership capabilities that
he knows what it takes to take a new
country and to give it the stability, the
drive, and the spirit that will make it a
major force in that area of the world,
but also a man who does not think of his
own country as just an island, who is not
parochial, as are too many of the lead-
ers in the world today, but one who sees
the whole world, as one who realizes that
what happens 5,000 miles away in India
and Pakistan affects him, as one who sees
that what happens in the Mideast af-
fects him and his people, as one who sees
that what happens in any part of the
world affects his country, although it is
very easy to become obsessed with your
own problems.
And for that reason, tonight I know
that all of you-not only because we ad-
mire our distinguished guest for his
leadership of his own country, with the
best record of national growth and per
capita income of any of the nations of
black Africa, but also because he has dem-
onstrated that he has that rare ability
to see beyond the problems of the moment
and look to the problems of the future,
to see beyond the geographical problems
that involve only his own island as it ex-
ists in the West Coast of Africa, and see
beyond and see the whole world, because
he is, truly, one whose views on the world
scene can affect the world-it is for this
reason that this house is honored for the
third time to have him as our guest.
And so in presenting him to you,
present a man who represents his own
country with great distinction, a man who
is also one who understands and is a great
