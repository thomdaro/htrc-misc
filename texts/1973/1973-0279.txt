94 Remarks During a Meeting With Representative
Corinne C. Boggs of Louisiana.
WELL, I WANT to say while you are
here—as Mrs. Boggs was saying—this is a
sad day in a way, but also a very happy
day because all of the family is here to see
you sworn into Congress.
And I suppose many will interpret her
victory and also her service as simply the
fact that she was the wife of the promi-
nent majority leader of Congress, and that
because of that and only because of that,
she is here.
However, those of us who know her,
as I know her, my wife knows her, we
have had the privilege of traveling with
her on several occasions, she is here in her
own right as well. I think her husband
would have said that she, on her own,
belongs in the Congress of the United
States. And I speak in a completely bi-
partisan way when I say I hope she stays
a long time.
March 27, 1973
REPRESENTATIVE BOGGS. Thank you,
Mr. President, so much.
THE PRESIDENT. If I move to Louisiana,
I might I will vote for you. [Laughter]
REPRESENTATIVE BOGGS. That is won-
derful. Thank you so much, Mr. Presi-
dent.
THE PRESIDENT. What I meant is that
you made it on your own. That is the
point.
REPRESENTATIVE BOGGS. Thank you
very much.
NOTE: The exchange of remarks began at 3
p.m. in the Oval Office at the White House
where the President was meeting with Mrs.
Boggs.
On March 20, 1973, Mrs. Boggs was elected
to succeed her late husband, Representative
Hale Boggs, House majority leader, who was
lost with Representative Nick Begich of Alaska
on an airplane flight in Alaska, October 15,
1972.
