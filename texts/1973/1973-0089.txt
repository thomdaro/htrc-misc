Richard Nixon, 1973
Jan. 29 [21]
The Congress must accept responsibility
for the budget totals and must develop a
systematic procedure for maintaining fis-
cal discipline. To do otherwise in the light
of the budget outlook is to accept the
responsibility for increased taxes, higher
interest rates, higher inflation, or all three.
In practice, this means that should the
Congress pass any legislation increasing
outlays beyond the recommended total, it
must find financing for the additional
amount. Otherwise, such legislation will
inevitably contribute to undue inflationary
pressures and thus will not be in the public
interest. And it will be subject to veto.
I will do everything in my power to
avert the need for a tax increase, but I
cannot do it alone. The cooperation of
the Congress in controlling total spending
is absolutely essential.
SUMMARY OF THE 1974 BUDGET
The 1974 budget proposes an approxi-
mate balance in full-employment terms
and an actual deficit that is about one-
half the 1973 deficit. The 1975 budget
totals I propose here would also yield a
balance in full-employment terms.

ment Act program are calculated as they would be under conditions of full employment.
