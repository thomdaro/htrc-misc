Annual Message to the Congress: The Economic
Report of the President. January 30, 1973
To the Congress of the United States:
As predicted, 1972 was a very good
year for the American economy.
From the end of 1971 to the end of
1972, total output rose by about 7Â½ per-
cent. This is one of the largest 1-year
in-
creases in the past 25 years. This growth
took place in a largely peacetime econ-
omy; it was not achieved by a war-fed,
inflationary boom. In fact, real defense
spending declined 5 percent during the
year. More important is the fact that the
big increase of production in the year
just ended was accompanied by a reduced
rate of inflation. Consumer prices in-
creased a little more than 3 percent from
1971 to 1972-a far cry from the runaway
inflation rate of 6 percent that confronted
us in 1969.
A year ago, looking ahead to 1972, I
said that the great problem was to get the
unemployment rate down from the 6-per-
cent level where it was in 1971. During
1972 the rate was reduced to a little over
5 percent. We should get this down fur-
ther, and expect to do so, but what was
accomplished was gratifying. It is espe-
cially significant that the total number
of people at work rose by 2.3 million from
1971 to 1972, the largest 1-year increase
in 25 years.
Everything was not ideal in 1972-in
the economy any more than in other
aspects of our national life. Rising food
prices were a major concern. The U.S.
balance of trade with other countries did
not improve as we had hoped. But all-in-
all it was a very good year.
The economic performance of 1972
owed much to sound and forceful Gov-
ernment policy. The history of this policy
goes back before 1972, and back before
the dramatic moves taken on August 15,
1971. It goes back to the decision made in
1969 to bring to an end the dangerous
inflation that had started in the mid-
sixties. The decision was carried out by
slowing down the rise of Federal spend-
ing and continuing the temporary tax
increase that had been enacted in 1968
and by tightening monetary conditions.
As a result, much of the cause of the in-
flation was removed and the rise in the
cost of living was moderated. Without
these steps, the subsequent success of
price and wage controls would have been
impossible.
Curbing inflation and cutting back on
defense production necessarily involved a
downturn in the economy and a rise of
unemployment. To keep this from going
too far, fiscal and monetary policy shifted
in an expansive direction in 1970. And to
speed up both the decline of inflation and
the recovery of the economy, I an-
nounced the New Economic Policy on
August 15, 1971. Temporary controls
were imposed on prices, rents, and wages.
Taxes were reduced. A little later we
moved to stimulate the economy further
by boosting Government expenditures in
the first half of 1972, mainly by bringing
forward expenditures that would have
been made later.
The policies that began in 1969 con-
tributed to the economic progress so visible
in 1972. But Government policies alone
did not do the job. Credit goes largely
to a strong private economy and to the
private citizens who cooperated in rais-
