Message to the Congress Transmitting Annual Report
on the Food for Peace Program. July 13, 1973
To the Congress of the United States:
I am pleased to transmit to the Con-
gress the 1972 annual report on agricul-
tural export activities carried out under
Public Law 480. This program has once
again demonstrated the desire of the peo-
ple of the United States to help those in
other countries who are less fortunate than
ourselves and stand in need of our
assistance.
Through food donations and conces-
sional sales of agricultural commodities,
the Public Law 480 program in 1972
helped alleviate immediate problems aris-
ing from inadequate food supplies, and
helped to lay the basis for new agricultural
production in many countries throughout
the world. A major impact of this pro-
gram came through our assistance to the
distressed victims of war and natural disas-
ters in Bangladesh.
Other principal recipient countries of
development and emergency assistance in-
cluded Korea, Vietnam, Israel, Pakistan,
India and Indonesia. By assisting such
countries, the Public Law 480 program
also helps to offset threats to internal
stability and contributes to our objective
of reducing the level of international
tensions.
The White House,
July 12, 1973.

grams operating under various narrow
legislative authorities. This study lends
