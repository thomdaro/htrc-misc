Public Papers of the Presidents
316 Message to the Congress Transmitting Annual Reports
on Highway, Traffic, and Motor Vehicle Safety
Programs. October 30, 1973
To the Congress of the United States:
Ever since the Highway Safety and the
National Traffic and Motor Vehicle
Safety Acts were passed in 1966, the fatal-
ity rate on our Nation's highways has been
falling. In 1967, the number of deaths per
100 million miles driven was 5.5. By 1972
it had dropped by 18 percent to 4.5.
A wide range of programs have contrib-
uted to this decrease, programs designed
to increase the safety of our highways, our
motor vehicles and the driving habits of
our motorists. The full impact of many of
these safety programs still has not been
felt, and there is reason for us to expect
still greater progress in the future.
Unfortunately, the success we have en-
joyed in reducing the fatality rate has not
been extended to reducing the total num-
ber of highway deaths. In 1967, 53,000
persons died in motor vehicle accidents
of various kinds. By 1972 that annual toll
had risen to an estimated 57,000-a truly
shocking level.
The discrepancy between the falling
rate of fatalities and the rising number
of deaths is explained, of course, by the
fact that the number of vehicle miles
driven in this country increased by more
than 300 billion between 1967 and 1972.
The total mileage driven in 1972 was 1.25
trillion. In short, our safety measures, ef-
fective as they have been, have not been
able to hold in check the total number of
highway deaths occasioned by the vastly
greater use of our highways.
My Administration is profoundly com-
mitted to the cause of highway safety. The
annual toll which traffic accidents take
in lives and in injuries is more than any
society should have to bear. And the an-
nual financial cost of traffic accidents is
now estimated at nearly $50 billion.
It is my hope that this three-volume
report on the Highway Safety and Na-
tional Traffic and Motor Vehicle Safety
Acts of 1966, by reviewing the challenge
of traffic safety and by detailing our ef-
forts to meet it, will increase our aware-
ness and enhance our effectiveness in this
vital field.
