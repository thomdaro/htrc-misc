AS THE new Director of ACTION
takes office today, I am pleased to reaffirm
the commitment of this Administration
to America's volunteer programs both at
home and abroad.
One of the greatest potential forces for
solving contemporary social problems is
voluntarismâ€”the helping hand that each
of us can give to those in need. Two years
ago, in order to tap that resource more
effectively, we brought a number of fed-

chapters in the history of voluntarism in
America. I hope the American people will
join me in giving this important work our
strong support.

2,250 lawyers are assisting the needy in
about 900 neighborhood law offices.
We have learned many lessons during
this time. We have learned, for instance,
that any federally sponsored effort which
runs counter to State and local officials is
sure to spark controversy. We have
learned that Federal programs with
noble social aims must be carefully struc-
tured to mitigate abuse by those who run
them. But more than anything else, we
have learned that legal assistance for the
