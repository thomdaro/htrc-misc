Public Papers of the Presidents
THE PRESIDENT. That is a Senator's
way of saying no. [Laughter]
There is the bill. I would like to give it
to one of you, but that has to go to the
Archives. So, under the circumstances, it
has to go here in this little box.
The Alaska pipeline is on its way. The
environment will be saved, right?
SENATOR JACKSON. Right.
THE PRESIDENT. No problem.
Mark, you are an environmentalist,
right?
SENATOR MARK O. HATFIELD. Right.
THE PRESIDENT. You have no prob-
lems on the pipeline?
SENATOR HATFIELD. No great problems.
THE PRESIDENT. No great problems.
That is a way of saying there could be.
I want to say that this is the first piece
of legislation in this area that we have.
I am glad that with Senator Jackson's
leadership and others in the House and
the Senate I mention both Republicans
and Democrats-that we trust that before
the session is completed, we can have ac-
tion on some of the other matters.
And I understand that is quite possible;
is it not?
SENATOR JACKSON. Yes, sir.
THE PRESIDENT. What do you think
we can get, Senator?
SENATOR JACKSON. We have the man-
datory allocations bill which I presume
you are about ready to sign.
THE PRESIDENT. Right.
SENATOR JACKSON. And of the next,
we are right now, at this moment, we are
going back to vote on amendments in
connection with the authority that you
need to deal with the developing short-
ages. We will pass that by, say, Monday.
Then, we will be reporting to the Sen-
ate the research and development bill.
THE PRESIDENT. Right. That is long-
term, though.
SENATOR JACKSON. That is right. That
is a 10-year program of $2 billion a year,
comparable to what you have proposed on
a 5-year. It is the same thing.
And then, we have the strategic reserve
bill. So, there will be five bills.
THE PRESIDENT. Elk Hills?
SENATOR JACKSON. Yes. We have got
some problems on Elk Hills that we have
to work out. We are working on that. I
have been talking to Mel Laird. He may
have to go over to the Defense Depart-
ment again to resume duties for a tem-
porary period.
THE PRESIDENT. I am going to be
down to see Uncle Carl Vinson, Sunday.
SENATOR JACKSON. I will be there, too.
Mr. President, may I just say that we
want to thank you. We have our party
differences from time to time, but we are
all determined to proceed on a full bi-
partisan basis with the energy program.
We are doing this.
I might mention that when we had the
emergency bill up for markup for
amendments, we did something that
doesn't happen very often, that is, we had
Governor Love's representatives, Interior
representatives, and all the other repre-
sentatives participating in the markup,
amending the bill.
And we are proceeding on a bipartisan
basis to demonstrate to the world that we
are going to meet this problem and that
we can meet it. I just wanted to give you
that assurance and I know that I can help.
REPRESENTATIVE CRAIG HOS MER. Mr.
President, I think you ought to know that
we are also proceeding on a bicameral
basis on the House side on a lot of these
things, too. It is not only on the other
side.
SENATOR CLIFFORD P. HANSEN. Mr.
942
