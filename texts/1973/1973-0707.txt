Richard Nixon, 1973
[210]
July 20
I got out a little earlier than they
expected me to. I think part of the reason
was that I had good medical advice and
took it. And another reason is that I had
a very great lift from all the people who
served me so well while I was here.
Thank you very much. I have to get
210
back to work, and now you can go back to
work, too.
Thank you.
NOTE: The President spoke at 9: 14 a.m. on the
hospital grounds. He had entered the hospital
on July 12, 1973, for treatment for viral pneu-
monia.
Remarks to Members of the White House Staff on
Returning From Bethesda Naval Hospital.
July 20, 1973
THANK you very much for your very
warm welcome.
I had heard that while I was out at
Bethesda that you were all working, and
here you are outside. [Laughter]
you.
However, I do want you to know that
after a week away from the White House,
it is very good to be back, and particularly
good to be back to see all of
As I was at Bethesda, I realized that
that was the first time in 13 years I had
been in the hospital except for my physical
examinations. The other time was in the
year 1960 when, some of you may recall, I
had a knee infection and was at Walter
Reed for 2 weeks.
I told the staff at Bethesda that I
got
out perhaps a day or two early, not be-
cause their medication, which was excel-
lent, and their competence, which was
superb, but because their spirit lifted me.
And I can assure you, another reason
that I am back a little bit early is that
your spirit lifts me. And I am most grate-
ful for the fact that while I was there, a
few papers used to come out, you know,
the things you send out to me that I sign
without looking at-[laughter]-but in
any event, I do want you to know that
just the thought that while I was away
that the White House was going forward,
that all the work was being done, that
everything that needed to be done for this
country was going forward as I would
have wanted it to go forward and as the
people would want it to go forward—that
really helped me get back. And I thank
you very much for all those extra hours
that so many of you put in during that
time.
As you can imagine, while I was there,
I had a lot of chance to think, to sleep, to
rest. It is a little difficult, I must say, to
do some of those things when you are not
used to it. I mean I am used to thinking
but not to not sleeping and resting.
Also, I had a chance to go through
some of the mail that Rose ¹ sent out to
me, selected mail and wires from all over
the country. It seems that nothing really
touches people more than illness. You
know, if you want to talk to somebody
and you say, "How are you feeling?” they
usually tell you. Then things really get
going. So, as far as this was concerned,
I found that I must have heard from
everybody in this country who had had
¹ Rose Mary Woods, Personal Secretary to
the President.
