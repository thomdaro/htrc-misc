Public Papers of the Presidents
would provide greater field capabilities
for coordination of Federal disaster as-
sistance with that provided by States
and local communities, and would be in
keeping with the objective of creating a
broad, new Department of Community
Development.
-OEP's responsibilities for measures to
ensure the continuity of civil govern-
ment operations in the event of major
military attack would be reassigned to
the General Services Administration, as
would responsibility for resource mo-
bilization including the management of
national security stockpiles, with policy
guidance in both cases to be provided
by the National Security Council, and
with economic considerations relating
to changes in stockpile levels to be co-
ordinated by the Council on Economic
Policy.
-Investigations of imports which might
threaten the national security-assigned
to OEP by Section 232 of the Trade
Expansion Act of 1962-would be re-
assigned to the Treasury Department,
whose other trade studies give it a
ready-made capability in this field; the
National Security Council would main-
tain its supervisory role over strategic
imports.
Those disaster relief authorities which
have been reserved to the President in the
past, such as the authority to declare
major disasters, will continue to be exer-
cised by him under these new arrange-
ments. In emergency situations calling for
rapid interagency coordination, the Fed-
eral response will be coordinated by the
Executive Office of the President under
the general supervision of the Assistant
to the President in charge of executive
management.
The Oil Policy Committee will con-
tinue to function as in the past, unaf-
fected by this reorganization, except that
I will designate the Deputy Secretary of
the Treasury as chairman in place of the
Director of OEP. The Committee will op-
erate under the general supervision of
the Assistant to the President in charge
of economic affairs.
DECLARATIONS
After investigation, I have found that
each action included in the accompany-
ing reorganization plan is necessary to ac-
complish one or more of the purposes set
forth in Section 901 (a) of title 5 of the
United States Code. In particular, the
plan is responsive to the intention of the
Congress as expressed in Section 901 (a)
(1), "to promote better execution of the
laws, more effective management of the
executive branch and of its agencies and
functions, and expeditious administration
of the public business;" and in Section
901 (a) (3), "to increase the efficiency of
the operations of the Government to the
fullest extent practicable:" and in Sec-
tion 901 (a) (5), "to reduce the number
of agencies by consolidating those having
similar functions under a single head, and
to abolish such agencies or functions as
may not be necessary for the efficient con-
duct of the Government."
While it is not practicable to specify
all of the expenditure reductions and
other economies which will result from
the actions proposed, personnel and
budget savings from abolition of the Na-
tional Aeronautics and Space Council and
the Office of Science and Technology
alone will exceed $2 million annually, and
additional savings should result from a re-
duction of Executive Pay Schedule posi-
tions now associated with other trans-
