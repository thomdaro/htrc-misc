Administration of Jimmy Carter, 1977
Over the past sixteen years, the number
of children under the age of five who have
died from accidental poisoning has de-
clined by 68 per cent. New and safer pack-
ages for dangerous products are a major
reason for this decline. But our children's
inclination to explore the unknown may
still lead them into dangers that no safety
measures can control.
To encourage the American people to
remember the dangers of accidental poi-
soning and to take appropriate preventive
measures, the Congress, by joint resolution
of September 26, 1961 (36 U.S.C. 165),
has requested the President to issue an-
nually a proclamation designating the
third week in March as National Poison
Prevention Week.
Now, THEREFORE, I, JIMMY CARTER,
President of the United States of America,
do hereby designate the week beginning
March 20, 1977, as National Poison Pre-
vention Week. I urge all Americans and
all agencies and organizations concerned
with the prevention of accidental poison-
ings and the welfare of our Nation's
youngsters to join in activities designed to
encourage the safe storage, use and han-
dling of poisonous household substances.
IN WITNESS WHEREOF, I have here-
unto set my hand this eleventh day of Feb-
ruary, in the year of our Lord nineteen
hundred seventy-seven, and of the Inde-
pendence of the United States of America
the two hundred and first.
JIMMY CARTER
