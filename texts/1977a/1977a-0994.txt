Administration of Jimmy Carter, 1977
ing areas of federal lands are opened to
other uses and lost to wilderness forever.
I endorse, and in some cases am propos-
ing to expand, all of the more than 24
million acres of wilderness proposals sub-
mitted to the Congress by previous Ad-
ministrations.
Among the proposed areas I will rec-
ommend to enlarge are the following:
-Idaho and Salmon River Breaks
Wilderness, Idaho;
-Guadalupe Escarpment Wildnerness,
New Mexico and Texas;
-Beartooth-Absaroka
Montana and Wyoming;
-Grand Canyon National Park, Ari-
zona;
Wilderness,
-Kenai Moose Range, Alaska.

WILD AND SCENIC RIVERS
To date only 19 free-flowing rivers,
totalling 1,655 miles, have been desig-
nated as part of the National Wild and
Scenic Rivers System. Another 31 rivers
have been identified as worthy of study
for designation in the future.
We must identify as quickly as possible
the best remaining candidates for inclu-
sion in the Wild and Scenic Rivers System
before they are dammed, channelized, or
damaged by unwise development along
their banks. As a first step, therefore, I am
I am submitting new wilderness pro- proposing legislation to add segments of
posals for:
-Arches National Park, Utah;
Canyon Lands National Park, Utah;
-Capitol Reef National Park, Utah;
-Buffalo National River, Arkansas.
I will soon submit a proposal to desig-
nate as wilderness portions of Gulf Island
National Seashore in Mississippi and Flor-
ida, and I will give early attention to
other wilderness proposals, including por-
tions of the Oregon Dunes National Rec-
reation Area, Oregon, and Aravaipa
Canyon, Arizona, which would be the first
wilderness area on Bureau of Land Man-
agement lands. In addition, I support the
objectives of the Endangered Wilderness
legislation now pending before Congress.
Members of my Administration have re-
cently testified in favor of immediate
wilderness designation or protective study
designation for all areas in this bill.
I recognize the special need to preserve
wilderness east of the Rockies and in
Alaska, and I am directing that federal
agencies expedite the preparation of wil-
derness proposals for these areas.
Finally, I have directed the Secretary of
the Interior to initiate a vigorous wilder-
eight rivers, totalling 1303 miles, to the
system:
-Bruneau River, Idaho;
-Pere Marquette River, Michigan;
-Dolores River, Colorado;
-Rio Grande River, Texas;
-Salmon River, Idaho;
-Skagit River, Washington;
-Upper Delaware River, Pennsylvania
and New York;
-Upper Mississippi River, Minnesota.
I further propose to designate twenty
river segments for study as potential addi-
tions to the National Wild and Scenic
Rivers System:
-Gila River, New Mexico;
Green River, Utah;
-Illinois River, Arkansas;
-North Fork of the Kern River,
California;
-Shenandoah River, Virginia and
West Virginia;
Sweetwater River, Wyoming;
-Cacapon River, West Virginia;
Columbia River, Washington;
-Guadalupe River, Texas;
-John Day River, Oregon;
-Loxahatchee River, Florida;
