Administration of Jimmy Carter, 1977
Jan. 31
retain enough flexibility so that we can
adjust the program up or down should
circumstances require. This two-year pro-
gram will provide the private sector with
a genuine opportunity to plan ahead.
B. Speed. Because of the need for an
immediate stimulus to consumer purchas-
ing power, we have included an $11.4
billion tax rebate and cash payment sec-
tion in our package which, if promptly
enacted by Congress, would permit us to
mail checks to taxpayers this spring. It
is simply impossible for public works and
public service employment programs to
get money into the economic stream that
quickly.
C. Fairness. Because we wanted to tar-
get the benefits of this program to those
most in need, the bulk of the reduction
in personal income taxes will go to low
and middle income taxpayers (Tables 2
and 3). The business tax reductions have
been specifically designed to reduce costs
and provide incentives not only for large
businesses but for small ones as well. The
spending and job creation programs will
be targeted to the hard core unemployed
and to those communities hurt most by
the recent recession.
D. Effectiveness. Our program only
promises what can realistically be done.
We are proposing major expansions of
existing programs within a short period
of time. To force more money, faster, into
the system would risk poor administration.
E. Limitation on Permanent Budget
Cost. Because we are committed to a bal-
anced Federal budge for fiscal year 1981,
we want to hold down the size of perma-
nent spending increases or tax reduction.
The tax rebate and many of the spending
programs are temporary, and will end as

As the chart indicates, over 54 percent of the benefits from the tax rebates will go to those with ad-
justed gross incomes of less than $15,000 and an additional 20 percent of the benefits will go to
those earning between $15,000 and $20,000.
