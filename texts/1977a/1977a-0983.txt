I. POLLUTION AND HEALTH
At the beginning of this decade, the
United States embarked on a long over-

make our environment healthier and
more livable. My Administration fully

has been enacted. We are particularly
committed to strong measures to protect
our most important resource-human
health-from the increasingly apparent
problem of hazardous substances in the
environment.
• We plan to improve enforcement of
our pollution control laws.
• We intend to make increased use of
economic incentives to achieve our en-

• We will seize opportunities to reduce
pollution by conserving resources.
We will work with state and local
governments to make sure that the job of
controlling pollution is properly planned
and does not stop with the promulgation
of regulations in Washington.
• We will make every effort to see that
regulation of a problem in one medium-
such as water does not create new
environmental problems in another me-

• And we will squarely face emerging
environmental problems so that they can
be dealt with effectively without an at-
