INAUGURAL ADDRESS OF PRESIDENT
JIMMY CARTER
Following His Swearing In as the 39th President of the United States.
January 20, 1977
For myself and for our Nation, I want to thank my predecessor for
all he has done to heal our land.
In this outward and physical ceremony, we attest once again to the
inner and spiritual strength of our Nation. As my high school teacher,
Miss Julia Coleman, used to say, "We must adjust to changing times and
still hold to unchanging principles."
Here before me is the Bible used in the inauguration of our first Pres-
ident, in 1789, and I have just taken the oath of office on the Bible my
mother gave me just a few years ago, opened to a timeless admonition
from the ancient prophet Micah: "He hath showed thee, O man, what is
good; and what doth the Lord require of thee, but to do justly, and to love
mercy, and to walk humbly with thy God."
This inauguration ceremony marks a new beginning, a new dedica-
tion within our Government, and a new spirit among us all. A President
may sense and proclaim that new spirit, but only a people can provide it.
Two centuries ago, our Nation's birth was a milestone in the long
quest for freedom. But the bold and brilliant dream which excited the
founders of this Nation still awaits its consummation. I have no new
dream to set forth today, but rather urge a fresh faith in the old dream.
Ours was the first society openly to define itself in terms of both spirit-
uality and human liberty. It is that unique self-definition which has given
us an exceptional appeal, but it also imposes on us a special obligation
