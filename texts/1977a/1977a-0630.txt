By the President of the United States
of America
A Proclamation
Our nation's small businesses employ
100 million Americans and produce
produce
nearly half of our gross business product.
Small businesses remain healthy in an
economic environment that equates size
with success because they take an active
interest in the customers and communi-
ties they serve.
A successful small business is evidence
of the independence, initiative and hard
work of the man or woman who owns
and operates it. Their spirit has been, and
will continue to be, a major factor in our
nation's growth.
Now, THEREFORE, I, JIMMY CARTER,
President of the United States of America,
do hereby designate the week beginning
Sunday, May 22, 1977, as Small Business
Week, and I ask all Americans to join me
in expressing the pride we take in our
nation's small business sector.
IN WITNESS WHEREOF, I have here-
unto set my hand this fourteenth day of
April in the year of our Lord nineteen
hundred seventy-seven, and of the Inde-
pendence of the United States of America
the two hundred and first.
JIMMY CARTER
