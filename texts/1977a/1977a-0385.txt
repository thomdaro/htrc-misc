Administration of Jimmy Carter, 1977
Strauss will establish a blind trust with
an independent trustee to hold his invest-
ment securities while he serves as Special
Trade Representative. These securities
are well diversified, except that 35% of
the portfolio is represented by the stock
of the Valley View State Bank and 30%
by the stock in his family-owned Strauss
Broadcasting Co. The retention of these
securities requires the President's approval
of the exception.
The President explained that his rea-
sons for approving the exception are:
(1) As Special Trade Representative,
Strauss will disqualify himself from act-
ing on matters affecting the interest of
either of those companies; such a dis-
qualification will seldom, if ever, prevent
his acting on a matter.
(2) To require Strauss to divest by sale
of these securities would cause a serious
depletion of his family assets because of
the capital gains taxes he would have to
pay.
