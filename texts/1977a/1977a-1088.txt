gress enacted the Commission's recom-
mendations as the International Broad-
casting Act of 1973, Public Law 93-129,

The International Broadcasting Act of
1973 set up the Board "to provide an ef-
fective instrumentality for the continua-

constructive dialog with the peoples of

Board, according to the act, are to be "se-
lected by the President from among
Americans distinguished in the fields of
foreign policy or mass communications"
and may not be concurrently full-time em-
ployees of the U.S. Government.
In addition to providing funds for
operation of the radios, the Board is re-
quired "to assess the quality, effectiveness
and professional integrity of their broad-
casting within the context of the broad
foreign policy objectives of the United
States." At the same time it is charged
with keeping in mind "the necessity of
maintaining the professional independ-
ence and integrity" of these stations. In
addition to receiving congressionally ap-
propriated funds for the stations, the
Board is authorized to receive funds from
private sources.
Active in many fields of academic en-
deavor and public affairs, Dr. Gronouski
is married to the former Mary Louise
Metz and has two daughters, Stacey and

Presidential Scholars of 1977. June 9, 1977
THE PRESIDENT. I need to get you to help
me with a lot of things. I think I will just
substitute you for the Congress. [Laughter]
I spent this morning meeting with 50
Members of Congress, mostly from the
Southwest, from Illinois all the way down
through Texas. And this morning for
breakfast, with the leadership of the Con-
gress, I feel like my life now is one mas-
sive multiple choice examination where
things are put in front of me and I have
to make the difficult decisions.
I'm very grateful to have a chance to
come over here for a few minutes to first
of all congratulate you, and secondly to
call on you for continued help. You've
been chosen in an intensely competitive
way, based on merit alone. But, of course,
with an opportunity that you've had
comes commensurate responsibility. The
avenue you've enjoyed coming into Gov-
ernment, looking at it from a fresh per-
spective, is one that's very valuable to me
and to our country. And I hope that when
