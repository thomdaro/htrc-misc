Proclamation 4502. April 15, 1977
By the President of the United States
of America
A Proclamation
For more than two centuries, the
United States has relied on the Merchant
Marine for trade and defense. The Mer-
chant Marine has contributed to our eco-
nomic growth and military strength.
The men and women of our Merchant
Marine have worked hard to export our
products to foreign markets, and import
foreign goods for our use and pleasure.
Those who serve in the Merchant
Marine have the spirit, the character, and
devotion to duty that have made our na-
tion strong, free, and prosperous.
the
In recognition of the importance
American Merchant Marine, the Con-
gress, by joint resolution of May 20, 1933
(48 Stat. 73, 36 U.S.C. 145) designated
May 22 of each year as National Mari-
time Day in commemoration of the de-
parture from Savannah, Georgia, on that
date in 1819 of the SS SAVANNAH on the
first transatlantic voyage by any steamship,
and requested the President to issue an-
nually a proclamation calling for its ap-
propriate observance.
Because May 22 falls on Sunday this
and in keeping with custom, it is
year,
appropriate to observe National Maritime
Day on the following Monday.
Now, THEREFORE, I, JIMMY CARTER,
President of the United States of America,
do hereby urge the people of the United
States to honor our American Merchant
Marine on May 23, 1977, by displaying
the flag of the United States at their
homes and other suitable places, and I re-
quest that all ships sailing under the
American flag dress ship on that day.
IN WITNESS WHEREOF, I have here-
unto set my hand this fifteenth day of
April in the year of our Lord nineteen
hundred seventy-seven, and of the Inde-
pendence of the United States of America
the two hundred and first.
JIMMY CARTER
