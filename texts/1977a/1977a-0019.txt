Administration of Jimmy Carter, 1977
Jan. 21
We need your active participation in a
joint effort to move the reality of the
world closer to the ideals of human free-
dom and dignity.
As friends, you can depend on the
United States to be in the forefront of the
search for world peace. You can depend
on the United States to remain steadfast
in its commitment to human freedom
and liberty. And you can also depend on
the United States to be sensitive to your
own concerns and aspirations, to welcome
your advice, to do its utmost to resolve
international differences in a spirit of co-
operation.
The problems of the world will not be
easily resolved. Yet the well-being of each
and every one of us-indeed our mutual
survivalâ€•depends on their resolution. As
President of the United States I can as-
sure you that we intend to do our part. I
ask you to join us in a common effort
based on mutual trust and mutual respect.
Thank you.
