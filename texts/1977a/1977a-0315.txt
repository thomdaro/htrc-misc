Administration of Jimmy Carter, 1977
Mar. 5
to discriminate against women. And I
would presume that you would agree with
that statement, but apparently you don't.
MRS. NICHOLSON. Well, certainly I do.
MR. CRONKITE. Well, thank you very
much-
THE PRESIDENT. I think that's all.
Thank you,
ma'am.
MRS. NICHOLSON. Thank you.
MR. CRONKITE. Let's do move on. We
want to get as many questioners in as pos-
sible today.
Mike McGrath of Warsaw, Indiana,
has won the lottery to get on the air here.
Mr. McGrath, go ahead with your ques-
tion to President Carter.
MR. MCGRATH. Yes, sir. Mr. President,
sir, are you there?
THE PRESIDENT. Yes, sir. Go right
ahead, Mike.
INCOME TAX REBATE
MR. MCGRATH. Okay. There is a little
quotation thereâ€”I was awfully proud to
serve in the Vietnam war there. I was
aboard the U.S.S. Constellation there in
North Vietnam, there.
THE PRESIDENT. Yes.
MR. MCGRATH. But at any rate, is that
there tax rebate supposed to be for $50
or what?
THE PRESIDENT. I think it'll be more
than $50 for some people, Mike, depend-
ing on what your income is.
MR. MCGRATH. Oh.
THE PRESIDENT. The ones that make
above $25 or $30,000 a year don't get any
rebate, according to the latest action of the
Congress. And that means that a little bit
more would be available to those at the
lower levels of income.
In addition to that, there's a special
provision for allocation of funds to veter-
ans like yourself.
And in addition, we have a tax reduc-
tion that's permanent, by giving a higher
personal exemption of $3,000 for a mar-
ried couple. I think the latest version is
$2,400 for a single person. So, you'll get
about an equivalent of a 30-percent reduc-
tion in your income taxes for 1976 if you
are at the $10,000 or so level.
MR. MCGRATH. Mine might be a little
lower than that.
THE PRESIDENT. If you have a real high
income, like you seem to have, you might
get a little bit lower. But it won't be lower
than $50 in the tax rebate unless you are
well above the $25,000 level. And in addi-
tion, as I said, you'll get the permanent
reduction in your income taxes brought
about by the higher personal exemption.
That'll stay on the books even after the
stimulation package has gone.
MR. MCGRATH. Oh, okay.
THE PRESIDENT. Pretty good deal for
you, I think.
GI BILL
MR. MCGRATH. I think so.
Another thing, though, was somebody
told me at the factory where I work at, the
Peabody American Brands plant, some-
body told me that there GI bill was sup-
posed to have been reactivated or some-
thing. Is there anything to that at all?
THE PRESIDENT. Mike, I don't know
about the latest version of that. But if
you'll listen in on the radio program for
the next 10 or 15 minutes, I'll get the an-
swer for you and give it to you in a few
minutes.
MR. MCGRATH. That is fine. Thank
you, Mr. President.
THE PRESIDENT. Thank you, Mike.
MR. CRONKITE. I might note that the
President has a plan for just that. If he
doesn't have the answer here, he's got a
couple of aides standing by to see if they
can get them. It is Saturday afternoon. A
lot of Government offices are closed,
but he's going to do the best he can to get
them for you.
