June 17
Administration of Jimmy Carter, 1977
academies, I believe that the spiritual de-
velopment of the young men and women
who are destined to lead our Armed
Forces is as vital as any other aspect of
their growth.
In addition, the chapel and its asso-
ciated gallery and museum will serve as a
repository for artifacts and memorabilia of
the long and honorable story of Jewish
participation in the military history of our
country, from pre-Revolutionary times to
the present. In this way, the chapel will
contribute to the education of all cadets,
regardless of religion, and to the knowl-
edge of many thousands of visitors. And
in a broader sense, the chapel will sym-
bolize both the rich diversity of our Nation
and its fundamental unity.
It is an honor for me to commend and
congratulate all of you who are taking part
in the establishment of the Jewish Cadet
Chapel at West Point.
