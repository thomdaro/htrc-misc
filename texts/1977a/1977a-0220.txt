Administration of Jimmy Carter, 1977
fishery agreement for 1977 between the
United States and Japan, signed at Wash-
ington on February 10, 1977.
This Agreement is significant because
it is one of a series to be negotiated in ac-
cordance with that legislation. I urge that
the Congress give favorable consideration
to this Agreement at an early date. Since
60 calendar days of continuous session as
required by the legislation are not avail-
able before March 1, 1977, I strongly
recommend that the Congress consider
amendment of the "Fishery Conserva-
tion Zone Transition Act" in order to in-
corporate this Agreement within its over-
all provisions.
√Ålso transmitted for the information of
the Congress is a governing international
fishery agreement between the United
States and Japan for 1978-1982 initialled
at Washington on February 10, 1977.
This Agreement will be resubmitted for
favorable consideration following its sig-
nature by the United States and Japan
later this year.
