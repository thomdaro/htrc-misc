Nuclear Power Policy
Remarks and a Question-and-Answer Session
With Reporters on Decisions Following a
Review of U.S. Policy. April 7, 1977
THE PRESIDENT. Good morning, every-
body.
I have two items to discuss with you
this morning. Then I'd like to answer a
few questions.
ECONOMIC STIMULUS PACKAGE
One relates to the economy and the
need for continuing emphasis on the
stimulation package. Based on the best
information available to us now, we'll
have an accumulated spending shortfall
for this current fiscal year, fiscal year
1977, plus revenue collections in excess
of the anticipated amount, of about $10
billion. In other words, we have collected
about $10 billion more from the American
taxpayers than we anticipate spending in
1977.¹
I feel very strongly that this money
should go back to the American taxpay-
ers. We need it for the economy to main-
tain its present strength. And the only
equitable way that I see is through the
already prepared tax refund which would
average about $50 per person which, as
I have said before, would be about 30 per-
¹Later in the day, the White House Press
Office issued the following clarification of the
President's statement: "The Federal deficit is
expected to be $10 billion less than anticipated
this year, because we are collecting more in
taxes and spending less than we anticipated."
