Administration of Jimmy Carter, 1977
with wildlife habitat, agricultural and
forest products, stable ecosystems, and
park and recreation areas. However, un-
wise use and development of our riverine,
coastal, and other floodplains not only de-
stroy many of the special qualities of these
areas but pose a severe threat to human
life, health, and property.
Since the adoption of a national flood
control policy in 1936, the Federal Gov-
ernment has invested about $10 billion in
flood protection works. Despite substan-
tial efforts by the Federal Government to
reduce flood hazards and protect flood-
plains, annual losses from floods and ad-
verse alteration of floodplains continue to
increase.
The problem arises mainly from unwise
land use practices. The Federal Govern-
ment can be responsible for or can influ-
ence these practices in the construction of
projects, in the management of its own
properties, in the provision of financial
or technical assistance including support
of financial institutions, and in the uses
for which its agencies issue licenses or per-
mits. In addition to minimizing the dan-
ger to human and nonhuman communi-
ties living in floodplains, active floodplain
management represents sound business
practice by reducing the risk of flood
damage to properties benefiting from Fed-
eral assistance.
Because unwise floodplain develop-
ment can lead to the loss of human and
other natural resources, it is simply a bad
Federal investment and should be
avoided. In order to avoid to the extent
possible the long- and short-term adverse
impacts associated with the occupancy
and modification of floodplains and to
avoid direct or indirect support of flood-
plain development wherever there is a
practicable alternative, I have issued
an Executive order on floodplain
management.
