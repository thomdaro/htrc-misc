Comprehensive Employment
and Training Act
Amendments of 1977
Statement on Signing H.R. 2992 Into
Law. June 16, 1977
I have signed into law, H.R. 2992, the
Comprehensive Employment and Train-
ing Act Amendments of 1977.
This bill provides a 1-year extension
of appropriation authority for the Nation's
basic system for furthering employment
and training opportunities for the unem-
ployed and economically disadvantaged.
It is also the authority for many of my
economic stimulus employment programs.
I requested a simple extension for 1
year, fiscal year 1978, so that my admin-
istration could quickly provide needed
temporary employment and training pro-
grams under my economic stimulus pro-
gram. In the coming months, we will have
the time to review with the Congress the
issues and concerns for the employment
and training system of the future. The
results of our mutual deliberations will
form the basis for legislative recommenda-
tions for the next session of Congress.
I want to express my thanks to both
Houses of Congress for acting on this ex-
tension bill expeditiously. The Congress is
also making rapid progress on the last
remaining authorization for the economic
stimulus package, the bill to authorize new
initiatives to address youth unemploy-
ment. I look forward to receiving that bill
in the near future.
NOTE: As enacted, H.R. 2992 is Public Law
95-44, approved June 15.
