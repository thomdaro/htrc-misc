MISS PFENNINGER. I hope you will
continue this kind of direct contact with
the public.
THE PRESIDENT. Good luck to you.
MR. CRONKITE. I bet, Miss Pfenninger,
when they told you the best way to get a
job is just knock on a lot of doors, they
didn't ever suggest telephoning the Presi-
dent on a national call-in show, but it
seems to work. You're going to get an
answer from him.
Russ Wenz of Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania,
is on the phone, Mr. President.
much as possible any public speaking on
my part. I really need to learn more
about this job. And, as you know, I have
got a very good partner up here from
Minnesota-
MR. WENZ. Yes, indeed.
THE PRESIDENT. -who might be
available. I can't speak for him. But Fritz
Mondale might be a possibility. But I
appreciate very much the invitation.
If they would write me a letter, we
can give them an official answer on it.
And also I appreciate the concept of re-
MR. WENZ. Good afternoon, Mr. Presi- affirming our patriotism in not only a
dent.
THE PRESIDENT. Russ, how are you
doing?
MR. WENZ. Very well. I want to tell
you you are doing a wonderful job, and I
hope the Congress keeps you going.
THE PRESIDENT. Well, I think they
will.
PUBLIC SPEAKING ENGAGEMENTS
MR. WENZ. I have a brief review and
then a question. President Calvin Cool-
idge came to Granite Falls, Minnesota,
on July 29, 1928, to dedicate the monu-
ment of Colonel William Caldwell. He
was a Civil War hero. Last July the local
American Legion Post there suggested to
the mayor that they issue a proclamation,
July 29 of each year as Annual Presidents
Day.
On this day they are going to have a
reaffirmation of our national unity, prob-
lems, and what we can do, and pride in
the rededication of our national ideals
and that sort of thing.
The question, Mr. President, is, would
it be possible for you to accept an invi-
tation from the Governor of Minnesota
or Mayor Geller of Granite Falls to be
the speaker of National President's Day?
THE PRESIDENT. Mr. Wenz, I doubt it.
This first year I've tried to hold down as
national way but also a local way, as you
all have done.
MR. WENZ. One of the things we would
like to do is remind everyone that a num-
ber of men in their prime gave up their
lives or were injured seriously, you know.
That is why we have our freedom and
independence.
It's nice talking to you, sir, and thank
you, sir.
THE PRESIDENT. Good luck to you.
MR. CRONKITE. Thank you, Mr. Wenz.
And your next caller, Mr. President, is
Mr. Kerry Kimble of Fulton, Missouri.
Mr. Kimble?
WAR POWERS RESOLUTION
MR. KIMBLE. Yes. Mr. President, my
question covers the war powers resolu-
tion. And do you feel that it infringes
upon your power as Commander in Chief
in the limiting or getting the approval
from Congress to continue the use of
American forces in a certain situation past
the 60 days?
THE PRESIDENT. Mr. Kimble, it is a
reduction, obviously, in the authority
that the President has had prior to the
Vietnam war. But I think it's an appro-
priate reduction. My own attitude toward
government is that I would never see our
