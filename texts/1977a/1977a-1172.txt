Administration of Jimmy Carter, 1977
with the imported articles. By an evenly
divided vote, three USITC Commission-
ers determined serious injury to exist in
the monochrome television receiver in-
dustry and three Commissioners made no
determination of injury with respect to the
monochrome receiver industry. The Com-
missioners also had an evenly divided de-
termination on the question of injury to
that portion of the industry producing
subassemblies of color television receivers,
also provided for in item 685.20 of the
TSUS. On those articles on which an in-
jury determination was made, the Com-
mission recommended the imposition of
an increased tariff.
2. Pursuant to section 330 (d) of the
Tariff Act of 1930 (19 U.S.C. 1330 (d)),
in the case of an evenly divided vote on
serious injury the President may consider
the determination agreed upon by either
group of Commissioners as the determi-
nation of the Commission. On May 19,
1977, I determined to accept the determi-
nation of those Commissioners making no
determination of injury to the mono-
chrome television receiver industry as the
determination of the Commission and to
accept the determination of those Com-
missioners finding serious injury to that
portion of the industry producing subas-
semblies of color television receivers as the
determination of the Commission.
3. On May 19, 1977, pursuant to Sec-
tion 202(b)(1) of the Trade Act (19
U.S.C. 2252(b)(1)), and after taking
into account the considerations specified
in section 202(c) of the Trade Act (19
U.S.C. 2252 (c)), I determined to remedy
the serious injury found to exist by the
USITC through the negotiation of an
orderly marketing agreement with Japan,
the major supplier of color television re-
ceivers to the U.S. market, pursuant to
section 203(a)(4) of the Trade Act (19
U.S.C. 2253(a) (4)); and announced my
intention to conclude such an agreement
limiting the export from Japan into the
United States of color television receivers
and certain of their subassemblies, and
setting conditions under which the United
States would limit imports into the United
States of such articles. On May 19, 1977,
in accordance with section 203(b) (1) of
the Trade Act (19 U.S.C. 2253 (b) (1)),
I transmitted a report to the Congress
setting forth my determination and inten-
tion to conclude an orderly marketing
agreement and stating the reasons why
my decision differed from the action rec-
ommended by the USITC.
4. Section 203 (e) (1) of the Trade Act
(19 U.S.C. 2253 (e)(1)) requires that
import relief be proclaimed and take ef-
fect within 90 days after a Presidential
determination to negotiate an orderly
marketing agreement.
5. Pursuant to the authority vested in
the President by the Constitution and the
statutes of the United States, including
section 203 (a) (4) of the Trade Act (19
U.S.C. 2253 (a) (4)), an orderly market-
ing agreement was concluded on May 20,
1977, between the Government of the
United States of America and the Gov-
ernment of Japan, limiting the export
from Japan to the United States of color
television receivers and certain subassem-
blies thereof, for a period of three years
beginning July 1, 1977, to 1.75 million
units in each annual restraint period, and
setting forth conditions under which limi-
tations would be placed on the importa-
tion into the United States of such arti-
cles by the Government of the United
States. The agreeement shall be imple-
mented by the terms of the Notes ex-
changed and as directed in this proc-
lamation.
6. In accordance with section 203 (d)
(2) of the Trade Act (19 U.S.C. 2253
(d) (2)), I have determined that the level
