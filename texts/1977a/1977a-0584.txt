Administration of Jimmy Carter, 1977
We are most willing to cooperate with
you in reasserting the rule of law as an
arbiter among nations. Legitimacy should
replace force as a determinant of right
and wrong. The strength of nations
should be measured not by the power they
muster but by the values they uphold.
Mr. President and dear friends, we are
developing our bilateral relations along
lines which are apt to stimulate an ever-
growing cooperation for our mutual bene-
fit. In the short period that passed since
you assumed office, you demonstrated
your enthusiasm for intensifying such co-
operation. The measures you took in this
respect are symbolic of your genuine be-
lief in international solidarity. I have no
doubt that your Presidency will usher in
a new chapter in international relations.
May your vigorous efforts at home and
abroad be fruitful.
Ladies and gentlemen, I ask you to
stand in respect to my dear friend Presi-
dent Carter.
PRESIDENT CARTER. Thank you, sir.
Thank you, Mr. President, I appreciate
that very much.
God bless you.
NOTE:
The President spoke at 8:50 p.m. in
the State Dining Room at the White House.
