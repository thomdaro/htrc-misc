Administration of Jimmy Carter, 1977
Mar. 2
Well, I think you all see that this is a
new generation of leadership in dealing
with crucial elements of our Nation-car-
ing for those who have served, offering
an opportunity for nongovernmental em-
ployees who want to serve, and dealing
with foreign countries in the most sensi-
tive interrelationships here in Washing-
ton.
And I am very deeply thankful for
these young men who have shown their
willingness to serve again. So to Max Cle-
land and to Sam Brown and to Evan Do-
belle, I want to express my thanks and
my congratulations.
Now we will have the oath of office
administered.
