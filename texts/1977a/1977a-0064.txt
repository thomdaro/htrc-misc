reductions and the increase in the stand-

This program, if it is passed, should in-
crease the nation's output at a rate of
$14 to $18 billion per year by the end of
1977 and $25 to $35 billion per year by
the end of 1978. Together with the pre-
viously anticipated growth of the econ-
omy, the program should reduce unem-
ployment by almost one million by the end
of this year, with further significant re-
ductions in 1978.
The gross budget costs of the program
are estimated to be $15.5 billion in fiscal
year 1977 and $15.7 billion in fiscal year

Federal costs of about $3 billion and $8
billion in fiscal year 1977 and fiscal year
1978, respectively.
The economic program I have proposed
will set the stage for substantial growth in
the years ahead. It will restore consumer
confidence and consumer purchasing pow-

in a long-term growing economy; it will
pave the way for a balanced Federal budg-
et by fiscal year 1981.
The program will not aggravate cur-
