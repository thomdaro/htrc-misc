competitive with the imported articles.
The USITC recommended the imposi-
tion of certain tariff rate quotas on imports
of the above specified articles.
2. On April 1, 1977, pursuant to section
202(b)(1) of the Trade Act (19 U.S.C.
2252(b)(1)), and after taking into ac-
count the considerations specified in sec-
tion 202(c) of the Trade Act (19 U.S.C.
2252 (c)), I determined to remedy the in-
jury found to exist by the USITC through
the negotiation of orderly marketing
agreements with appropriate suppliers of
footwear, as authorized by section 203 (a)
(4) of the Trade Act (19 U.S.C. 2253 (a)
(4)); and announced my intention to ne-
gotiate such agreements calling for limits
on the export from certain foreign coun-
tries, and the import into the United
States, of certain footwear. On April 1,
1977, in accordance with section 203 (b)
(1) of the Trade Act (19 U.S.C. 2253 (b)
(1)), I transmitted a report to the Con-
gress setting forth my determination and
intention to negotiate orderly marketing
agreements and stating the reasons why
my decision differed from the action rec-
ommended by the USITC.

3. Section 203 (e) (1) of the Trade Act
(19 U.S.C. 2253 (e) (1)) requires that im-
port relief be proclaimed and take effect
within 90 days after a Presidential deter-
mination to negotiate orderly marketing
agreements.
4. Pursuant to the authority vested in
the President by the Constitution and the
statutes of the United States, including
section 203 (a) (4) of the Trade Act (19
U.S.C. 2253(a) (4)), orderly marketing
agreements were concluded on June 14,
1977, between the Government of the
United States of America and the Govern-
ment of the Republic of China, and on
June 21, 1977, between the Government
of the United States of America and the
Government of the Republic of Korea,
limiting the export from the Republics of
China and Korea, respectively, and the
import into the United States, of footwear
provided for in items 700.05 through
700.85, inclusive (except items 700.51,
700.52, 700.53, 700.54, 700.60, 700.75,
and disposable footwear designed for one-
time use provided for in item 700.85) of
the TSUS.
5. Pursuant to section 203 (k) (1) of the
Trade Act (19 U.S.C. 2253 (k)(1)), I
have considered the relation of such ac-
tions to the international obligations of
the United States.
6. In accordance with section 203 (d)
(2) of the Trade Act (19 U.S.C. 2253 (d)
(2)), I have determined that the level of
import relief hereinafter proclaimed per-
mits the importation into the United
States of a quantity or value of articles
which is not less than the average annual
quantity or value of such articles imported
into the United States from the Republic
of Korea, and from the Republic of China,
in the 1974-1976 period, which I have de-
termined to be the most recent represen-
tative period for imports of such articles.
Now, THEREFORE, I, JIMMY CARTER,
President of the United States of America,
acting under the authority vested in me by
the Constitution and statutes of the
United States, including section 203 of the
Trade Act (19 U.S.C. 2253), and section
301 of title 3, United States code, do
hereby proclaim:
(1) Orderly marketing agreements
were entered into on June 14, 1977, and
June 21, 1977, between the Government
of the United States of America and the
Government of the Republic of China and
the Government of the Republic of Korea,
respectively, with respect to trade in cer-
tain footwear, effective June 28, 1977.
The orderly marketing agreements ac-
count for a major part of the United
States imports of the articles covered by
the agreements. Said orderly marketing
agreements are to be implemented accord-
