Dear Mr. Speaker: (Dear Mr. Presi-
dent:)
One of the major goals of my Adminis-
tration will be to reorganize and stream-
line the Executive Branch to insure the
effective management of government pro-
grams. An indispensable tool in this ef-
fort-one available to every President be-
tween 1939 and 1973-will be the au-
thority to submit reorganization plans to
Congress for expeditious review and ap-
proval. Therefore, I am hereby transmit-
ting to you a draft bill entitled "To re-
establish the period within which the
President may transmit to the Congress
plans for the reorganization of agencies
of the Executive Branch of the govern-
ment, and for other purposes."
The bill provides for the following
changes to the Reorganization Act of
1949:
1. Extends the authority for four years.
