Administration of Jimmy Carter, 1977
Jan. 31
These rebates are intended to provide
prompt spending power to almost every
American. The Internal Revenue Serv-
ice can begin sending checks five weeks
after these proposals are enacted by the
Congress. The rebates and payments
would have a budgetary cost of $11.4
billion in 1977, and no impact in 1978.
This rebate will inject money into the
economic stream quickly. It will dis-
tribute its benefits widely, require little
paperwork, be of particular help to low
and middle income families, and use a
formula the American people can easily
understand.
2. Tax Reduction and Simplification.
I recommend a permanent increase in
the standard deduction, which now
ranges from $2,100 to $2,800 for couples
and from $1,700 to $2,400 for single per-
sons, to a flat $2,800 for couples and
$2,400 for single persons. Thus the exist-
ing complex standard deduction would
be replaced by a larger, flat standard
deduction.
This change would mean that 3.7 mil-
lion low-income taxpayers and their fam-
ilies would no longer have to pay taxes.
An additional 4 million taxpayers would
find it more advantageous to use the less-
burdensome standard deduction rather
than to itemize deductions each year.
This would be an important first step in
simplifying our tax returns, which are
particularly complicated this year.
If this proposal is adopted, roughly
75% of American taxpayers will be able
to take the standard deduction and make
a simple computation of their tax lia-
bility. As Table 3 indicates, all the bene-
fits of this reform will go to low and
middle income taxpayers.
This proposal would cost about $4 bil-
lion per year. The decline in receipts
would be $1.5 billion in fiscal year 1977
and $5.5 billion in fiscal year 1978, of
which roughly $1.5 billion would be re-
funds on 1977 tax liability.
3. Tax Relief for Business Firms. I
recommend that businesses be allowed to
take either a credit against income taxes
equal to 4 percent of Social Security pay-
roll taxes paid by the employer, or an
additional 2 percent credit for new in-
vestment in machinery or equipment.
Each firm could choose which credit to
take, but its choice would be binding for
a fixed number of years.
I hope that the program I have set
forth today will receive careful, prompt,
and full consideration by the Congress
of the United States. Our people are
ready to see the Executive and Legisla-
tive branches move from an era of con-
frontation to an era of cooperation.
Our common commitment is to put
America-its people, its plants, its inven-
tive genius-to work again.
