Termination of Natural
Gas Emergency
Proclamation 4495. April 1, 1977
By the President of the United States
of America
A Proclamation
On February 2, 1977, Proclamation
No. 4485 was issued which proclaimed
and declared the existence of a natural
gas emergency within the meaning of
Section 3 of the Emergency Natural Gas
Act of 1977. Such action was necessary
because of the imminent shortage of na-
tural gas for high-priority uses and the in-
adequacy of remedial measures other than
the extraordinary measures authorized by
Section 4 of that Act. Section 3 of the
Emergency Natural Gas Act of 1977, how-
ever, requires termination of such emer-
gency when the President finds that such
shortages no longer exist and are
longer imminent.
I now find that the severe natural gas
shortages which necessitated the declara-
tion of a natural gas emergency within
the meaning of Section 3 of said Act no
longer exist and are no longer imminent.
Now, THEREFORE, I, JIMMY CARTER,
President of the United States of Ameri-
ca, by virtue of the authority vested in
me by the Constitution and statutes of the
United States, including the Emergency
Natural Gas Act of 1977, do hereby pro-
claim and declare that the natural gas
emergency declared to exist by Proclama-
tion No. 4485 of February 2, 1977 is ter-
minated.
The fact that this winter's natural gas
emergency is over in no way signals an
end to our energy crisis. On the contrary,
it is a reminder that our natural gas sup-
ply is far short of potential demand. Un-
less we take remedial action to develop
a natural gas policy as part of a compre-
hensive energy policy, our economy, and
even our homes, will be in increasing
danger with each passing year. On April
20, 1977, I shall propose a policy to pro-
vide a long-term solution to our energy
problems.
IN WITNESS WHEREOF, I have here-
unto set my hand this first day of April,
in the year of our Lord nineteen hundred
seventy-seven, and of the Independence
of the United States of America the two
hundred and first.
JIMMY CARTER
