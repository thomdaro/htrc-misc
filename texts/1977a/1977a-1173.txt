Administration of Jimmy Carter, 1977
June 24
of import relief hereinafter proclaimed
permits the importation into the United
States of a quantity or value of articles
which is not less than the average annual
quantity or value of such articles imported
into the United States from Japan in the
1972-1975 period, which I have deter-
mined to be the most recent representa-
tive period for imports of such articles.
Now, THEREFORE, I, JIMMY CARTER,
President of the United States of America,
acting under the authority vested in me
by the Constitution and statutes of the
United States, including section 203 of the
Trade Act (19 U.S.C. 2253) and section
301 of Title 3 of the United States Code,
do hereby proclaim:
(1) An orderly marketing agreement
was entered into on May 20, 1977, be-
tween the Government of the United
States of America and the Government of
Japan with respect to the trade in certain
articles of color television receivers effec-
tive July 1, 1977. The orderly marketing
agreement with Japan accounts for a ma-
jor part of the United States imports of
the articles covered by the agreement.
The orderly marketing agreement is to be
implemented according to its terms and
as directed in this proclamation.

section 203 (e) (2) of the Trade Act (19

mation after any import relief proclaimed

(2) is no longer effective is hereby dele-
gated to the Special Representative, to be
exercised in conformity with paragraph

mination, the Special Representative shall
prepare any proclamations that may be
appropriate to implement import relief

Trade Act (19 U.S.C. 2253 (e) (3)).
(3) The President's authority in sec-
tion 203 (g) (1) and (2) of the Trade Act
(19 U.S.C. 2253 (g) (1) and (2)) to pre-
scribe regulations governing the entry or

ment and to issue rules and regulations

resentatives of the member agencies of the

the Special Representative shall, in addi-
tion to other necessary actions, institute
the following actions:

and from all other sources of articles cov-
ered by the agreement shall be collected

ment of Japan be exceeded, or should im-
ports from countries not parties to such
agreement increase in such quantities so
as to disrupt the effectiveness of the or-
derly marketing agreement, the Special
Representative, after consultation with
