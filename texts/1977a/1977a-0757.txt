Administration of Jimmy Carter, 1977
Apr. 29
In some cases heading in that direction
may seem inconvenient. But I have faith
that meeting this challenge will make our
lives more satisfying.
We can rediscover the ingenuity and
the efficiency which have made our nation
prosper, rather than deepening our de-
pendence on insecure imports and increas-
ingly expensive conventional energy sup-
plies. We can rediscover small-scale, more
creative ways of satisfying our needs. If
we are successful, we can protect jobs, the
environment, and the basic American
standard of living, not only for ourselves
but also for our children and grand-
children.
I know that, if we work together as a
united people, we will succeed.

Better Hearing and Speech
Month, May 1977
Message of the President. April 29, 1977
This traditional observance provides a
fine opportunity for all Americans to re-
flect on the needs of our twenty-two
million fellow citizens affected by hearing
and speech disorders.
All of us can be encouraged by the
steady increase in the numbers of men,
women and children who are overcoming
such handicaps. We can also find com-
fort in the continuing efforts of all the
organizations and individuals responsible
for guiding and developing programs to
assist those with hearing, speech or lan-
guage impediments. By promoting com-
munity activities relating to improved
health, rehabilitation and social care, you
are performing a vital public service.
I urge more Americans to volunteer
their time and energy to this worthwhile
cause.
