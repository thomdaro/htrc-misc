United States-Canada Reciprocal
Fisheries Agreement
Message to the Congress Transmitting the
Agreement. February 28, 1977
To the Congress of the United States:
I transmit herewith a Reciprocal Fish-
eries Agreement Between the Govern-
ment of the United States and the Gov-
ernment of Canada, signed in Washing-
ton, February 24, 1977.
The Agreement, which is for 1977 only,
satisfies important United States interests
both in United States fisheries off Canada
and in overall cooperative relations be-
tween the United States and Canada. The
Reciprocal Fisheries Agreement is not a
Governing International Fisheries Agree-
ment within the terms of the Fishery
Conservation and Management Act. The
reciprocal accommodations of United
States and Canadian interests required
inclusion in the Agreement of provisions
which are not consistent with certain sec-
tions of that Act.
Positive Congressional action there-
fore is required to bring the Reciprocal
Agreement into force. I believe it im-
portant to take this action in order that
there be no disruption of the important
United States-Canadian fisheries off Can-
ada following the establishment of the
United States 200-mile fishery conserva-
tion zone on March 1, 1977.
I recommend that the Congress give
favorable consideration of this Agreement
by March 1. I further recommend that
the Congress consider bringing the Agree-
ment into force by Joint Resolution, such
Resolution having the effect of establish-
