Administration of Jimmy Carter, 1977

home, perhaps one that has been used in
the past but still have a lot of living to be
done in it, that you all might be able to
afford it.
I think that we have now gotten the
housing industry turned around. As you
know, it was in a dormant stage. And
with the comprehensive guarantee of
home loans, the repair capabilities and
the community block grant program,
combined with the lowest interest rates
and the least inflation that we can main-
tain, perhaps you'll have a chance in the
future.
I wish I could give you a better answer
than that, but I can't.
Q. Thank you very much, Mr. Presi-
dent.
THE PRESIDENT. Good luck to you,
Linda.
Yes, sir, in the red jacket?
MILITARY COMMISSARIES
Q. Mr. President, my name is Randall
Tucker from Fullerton, U.S. Navy re-
tired, and my question pertains to the
military.
you
What percent of commissaries do
expect to be closed in the next 4 years,
and what area will be affected the most,
and why?
The President. Well, I don't expect
any appreciable number of the commis-
saries to be closed. The only proposal
that I've ever heard about the PX's or the
commissaries, is that they be self-support-
ing; that enough be charged in the prices
of the goods that Navy and other military
people buy just to pay the cost of opera-
tion of the commissary. But I don't think
that's too tight a constraint to put on the
military personnel.
I was in the Navy for 11 years myself.
And I can't remember now. I wouldn't
have any way to know if the commis-
saries paid their own way. But I don't
think it's unreasonable for the taxpayers
to demand that the military at least pay
enough for goods they buy to cover oper-
ating expenses.
Q. Thank you, sir.
THE PRESIDENT. Yes, in the San Fer-
nando Valley?
U.S. POSTAL SERVICE
Q. Mr. Kit Rhodes from the San Fer-
nando. My question is about postal sub-
sidy. We can put a man on the Moon, we
can get TV pictures back from Mars, and
yet it still takes 2 days to get a letter from
down the street. We subsidize airlines,
trains, airplane manufacturers, and yet
the post office money is a cutback. Why is
this?
And also with the reduction of service,
Saturdays dropped, reluctance to hire,
and all the methods that the Postal Serv-
ice is trying to cut back on moneys to keep
within their budget, it's just cutting down
on service to the people.
Mr. President, will you support a
postal subsidy bill and bring up the serv-
ice to the quality that the people expect
and deserve?
THE PRESIDENT. Well, I haven't even
been in office 4 months yet. [Laughter] I
haven't been able to do much about the
post office. The history of the independent
post office structure which we presently
have, as you know, has been one where
the Congress quite frequently has ap-
proved postal subsidies so that the rate of
mailing can be maintained as low as
possible.
I wouldn't want to make a promise to
you now that no matter what happened
in the future I would support a postal
subsidy bill. But I certainly will do all I
can.
As you know, the President has no
authority over the post office at all. But
I'll certainly do all I can to study the
