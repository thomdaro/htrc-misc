Democratic Congressional Dinner
Remarks at the 14th Annual Dinner.
May 25, 1977
I was really enjoying that speech that Tip
was making.
I am disappointed about one thing. I
was looking forward to having a chance
to dance in the open space.
When I got here Lee Kling and Chuck
Minot, Glen Watts apologized for having
filled up all of these tables and raising
$1,200,000 for next year's campaign.
I know, of course, that that's a great
tribute to them and to the fine work that
they have done, along with Wendell Ford
and Jim Corman, Speaker Bob Byrd. I
felt better about being on the program
tonight after I heard that they had cheap
musicians before me.
I have kind of had a busy day today
meeting with Crown Prince Fahd from
Saudi Arabia. I was telling him about the
difficulties that I have with the Govern-
ment, being new in it-the debates and
the arguments with Congress on occasion.
He said if I thought I had trouble, how
did I think it would be if all of you were
relatives of mine, as they are in Saudi
Arabia. [Laughter]
When he said that, I had the strangest
feeling just realizing that if I was in Saudi
Arabia, my brother Billy would be Crown
Prince. [Laughter]
Billy kind of has difficulty understand-
ing what goes on up here in Washington.
He cannot understand how the Members
of Congress can possibly disagree publicly
with the President. After last Saturday
afternoon, he called me up and said he
had a solution to the whole problem. I
said, "Billy, what is it?" He said, “I sug-
gest
that you commission all the Members
of Congress major generals in the Army."
[Laughter] Well, I told Billy I wasn't sure
that worked.
