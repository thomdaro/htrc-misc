United States Ambassador
to Italy
Remarks at the Swearing In of
Richard Gardner. March 18, 1977
THE PRESIDENT. Hello, everybody. It's
nice to have you here for a very impor-
tant occasion. We have known each other
for a long time, Richard Gardner and I
and his wife, Danielle.
During the 2 or 3 years that I was pre-
paring to take over as President, I had a
few very close and constant advisers, and
Richard Gardner was one of them. He
helped me in the preparation of some of
United Nations on nuclear proliferation
the major speeches that I made to the
and in analyzing foreign affairs. And I
was quite delighted when Cy Vance came
shortly after the inauguration to say, â€œWe
need very urgently to have an outstanding
Ambassador to Italy, and I have a recom-
mendation to make to you," and I was
particularly delighted when he said,
"It's Richard Gardner."
So, we had had a very common ap-
proach to the importance of our friend-
ship with Italy-a need to appoint a
superb person to serve there. And also we
have an added bonus in that Danielle will
fit in very well with the Italian commu-
nity, being part of it, and I think this is a
standard of diplomatic appointments
that I doubt that I can continue to equal
no matter how hard I try.
We have a very important friendship
with Italy. They are our staunch friend
and allies. And I believe that this will do
justice to them, and I know that Richard
Gardner and Danielle will make our
country proud of their service as Ambas-
sadors to Italy.
I would like to ask now Judge Higgin-
botham to give the oath, and I know that
all our people in this country are thankful
