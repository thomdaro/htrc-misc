May 26
Administration of Jimmy Carter, 1977
THE PRESIDENT. Well, I don't know
yet. I can't predict what will be decided.
But if there's any possibility for me to do
it properly and legally, I'll try not to dis-
appoint my Georgia friends.
Q. Is there much chance that you will
interrupt your vacation and go out and
talk to some of the shrimpers while you
are here?
THE PRESIDENT. I don't know; I
might. We just haven't decided about
that yet. Bo Ginn has given me a guaran-
tee of a thorough report on the shrimpers'
problems.
Q. Did you have to have a physical ex-
amination before going down? How deep
will you go under, do you know?
THE PRESIDENT. Well, that doesn't af-
fect—in the first place, no, I don't know
how deep we are going. But that would
not affect the physical condition of myself
or anyone else. The pressure inside a sub-
marine is maintained constant regardless
of the depth we go.
Q. You think you can handle a ship
still?
THE PRESIDENT. Oh, I think so. I think
so. They have got some automatic devices
to prevent serious errors. [Laughter] And
I am sure I will be well watched.
Q. We'll be waiting for you.
THE PRESIDENT. Are you all going
down to Cape Canaveral with us?
Q. Yes.
THE PRESIDENT. I think you are going
to enjoy it. The ones that don't go out on
the helicopter and all—as you probably
well know, Cape Canaveral has a lot of
good things to see.
Q. Can we give you a tape recorder to
record your comments?
THE PRESIDENT. Yes. Rex Granum 3 is
going to go out with me. And I hope that
you all will talk to Rex before we go out.
Rex?
Q. We're not adverse to going along.
Q. Let us in the crew.
THE PRESIDENT. They were just talk-
Q. How many hours have you logged ing about getting a complete report back
on subs?
THE PRESIDENT. Oh, I don't know.
The longest I was ever under the surface
without coming up was 19 days. But I
was on a submarine for 2 years, in and
out of ports. We took long trips to the
eastern coast of China, beginning in late
1948. And I left the submarine force in
the winter of 1953. So, I spent months and
months at sea and long periods of time
submerged.
Q. Are you anxious to take the helm?
THE PRESIDENT. Yes, I am. I'm look-
ing forward to it. I have never operated
on a nuclear submarine before. I left the
Navy before the nuclear subs actually be-
gan to operate.
I was a senior officer in charge of get-
ting the second nuclear submarine ready
for sea, working under Rickover then.
That was in 1951, '52, and '53.
on the submarine and whether we'd have
tape recordings or not. I thought you
might talk to them before we go and may-
be take a tape recorder along.
MR. GRANUM. I thought we would.
THE PRESIDENT. Several times during
the day you might ask me questions and
I would respond to you.
MR. GRANUM. I thought we might just
hang there and get some of the quotes,
and so forth.
THE PRESIDENT. Okay.
Q. The Atlanta Constitution will pay
for it. [Laughter]
REPORTER. Thank you. Have a good
time.
THE PRESIDENT. Thank you. We will
see you later.
NOTE:
The exchange began at 3:25 p.m. at
the Brunswick Golden Isles Glynco Jetport.
