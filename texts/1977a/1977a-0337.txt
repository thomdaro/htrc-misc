Administration of Jimmy Carter, 1977
Mar. 5
time to give the answer to you by the end
of the program since we only have about
15 minutes to go. But I'll try to get the
answer back to you.
MRS. HEWITT. May I say my brother's
last wish was to be buried in Georgia in
Bluffton. Noland Frisbee-he was in the
service there, and he had written me
many letters about Georgia and how
lovely it was.
THE PRESIDENT. Thank you very
much.
MRS. HEWITT. Beautiful people there.
THE PRESIDENT. Thank you so much.
I might say in Plains, which is a tiny little
town, we have a Hewitt family. Maybe
they are kin to you and your brother.
MRS. HEWITT. No, my name was Fris-
bee before. It is Noland Frisbee. He is
passed away now, but his request was to
be buried in Bluffton where his family is
now.
THE PRESIDENT. Very good. Thank
you, ma'am.
MR. CRONKITE. Thank
Hewitt.
you, Mrs.
John Caldwell of Atlanta, Georgia, is
on the phone, Mr. President. I'm advised
he is 17 years old.
Mr. Caldwell?
MR. CALDWELL. Yes, good afternoon,
President Carter.
THE PRESIDENT. How are you doing?
PRESIDENTIAL RETREATS
MR. CALDWELL. I am 17 years old.
And I'd like to know, do you plan to
make any other place than Plains,
Georgia, your White House away from
Washington?
THE PRESIDENT. No, sir.
MR. CALDWELL. Okay, thank you.
THE PRESIDENT. The only other place
I anticipate going on a fairly regular
basis, as I mentioned earlier in the pro-
gram, is to Camp David, which is a place
for Presidents and has been used ever
since Franklin Roosevelt was in office. But
I don't intend to have several White
Houses as has been the case in the past.
MR. CALDWELL. Yes, sir. Thank you
very much.
MR. CRONKITE. Thank you, John
Caldwell.
The next caller on the line is Miss Les-
lie Pfenninger, Lanham, Maryland, Mr.
President.
Miss Pfenninger?
MISS PFENNINGER. Hello, President
Carter. It's good to speak with you.
THE PRESIDENT. Thank you, Leslie.
CIVIL SERVICE EMPLOYMENT
MISS PFENNINGER. I'm a 1976 college
graduate with a goal of working for Civil
Service, and I've been working toward
that goal since May. I might say it's a
depressing effect to find the doors com-
pletely shut.
I'd like to know if the restrictions will
be lifted to permit individuals like me to
compete for jobs now only open to those
currently in Civil Service or those of a
reinstatement status.
THE PRESIDENT. Leslie, what is your
profession or special training?
MISS PFENNINGER. I have a dual B.A.
in psychology and sociology, and I also
qualify as a statistician.
THE PRESIDENT. The best thing for me
to do is to check on your particular case
with the Civil Service and give you a call
back this coming week about prospects
for employment in the future. I presume
that the Civil Service has a record of your
application. Is that correct?
MISS PFENNINGER. Yes, sir, they do.
THE PRESIDENT. We'll be back in touch
with you next week.
MISS PFENNINGER. Thank you, Mr.
President.
THE PRESIDENT. Good luck.
