Administration of Jimmy Carter, 1977
June 10
I urge everyone who participates in
boating on American waterways to learn
the basic rules of safety. This information
is readily available in courses offered by
such organizations as the United States
Coast Guard Auxiliary, the United States
Power Squadrons, the American Red
Cross, and by various agencies of state
governments.
I also invite the Governors of the
States, the Commonwealth of Puerto
Rico, the Virgin Islands, Guam, and
American Samoa, and the Mayor of the
District of Columbia, to provide appro-
priately for the observance of the Week.
IN WITNESS WHEREOF, I have here-
unto set my hand this ninth day of June,
in the year of our Lord nineteen hundred
seventy-seven, and of the Independence
of the United States of America the two
hundred and first.
