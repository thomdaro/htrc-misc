Now, THEREFORE, I, JIMMY CARTER,

I am instructing federal officials to dis-
play the flag of the United States on all
Government buildings on that day, and I
urge all citizens to display the flag at their
homes and other suitable places.
I ask all Americans to make a special
effort this year to let our Nation's fathers
know that they will always have our love
and gratitude.
IN WITNESS WHEREOF, I have here-
unto set my hand this seventh day of June,
in the year of our Lord nineteen hundred
seventy-seven, and of the Independence
