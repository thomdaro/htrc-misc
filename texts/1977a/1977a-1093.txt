Administration of Jimmy Carter, 1977
June 9
eral, I think the trend has been for the
benefit of working families, even as a re-
sult of the industrial revolution. And I
have good hopes about the future.
There have been some leaders in our
own country who have maintained the
posture either secretly or openly that the
democratic processes were doomed and in
a showdown, 15, 20, 25 years in the future
that the Socialist or Communist nations
were inevitably going to prevail. I don't
agree with that at all. I see a strong re-
surgence of influence and strength in the
democratic societies. I think that one sig-
nificant result was that when I went to
the NATO Conference last month, for
the first time in the history of NATO, all
its participating members are democra-
cies. And the fact that Spain has now
shifted to a democratic society, and
Portugal the same, I think is a good move
in the right direction.
And so, I think that the trends are in
the direction of enhanced freedom, of
enhanced opportunity for achievement,
and also in the direction of enhanced
equality of a quality of life.
Thank you very much.
