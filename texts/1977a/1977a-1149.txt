Administration of Jimmy Carter, 1977
June 21
Corps of Engineers' authority to provide
emergency water supplies are subject to
abuse and, to be effective, must be closely
coordinated with the several drought pro-
grams already in operation.
I therefore expect this new authority
to be exercised in consultation with the
existing Interagency Drought Coordinat-
ing Committee, chaired by the Secretary
of Agriculture. This will prevent any
duplication of effort or expenditure and
promote prompt and efficient assistance
to those eligible. I also expect the program
to be administered in an environmentally
safe way and in a way that minimizes
ground water depletion.
NOTE: As enacted, H.R. 6197 is Public Law
95-51, approved June 20.
