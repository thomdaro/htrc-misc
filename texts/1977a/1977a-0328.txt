Mar. 5
Administration of Jimmy Carter, 1977
They make them assess very carefully
their trade policies.
So, I believe that the lending procedure
in foreign aid is much better than the gift
procedure, and when direct grants are
made, we ought to do more than we have
in the past to get the grants to people who
actually need it.
Within those changes, I think that our
present level of foreign aid is about right,
John.
MR. MELFI. Okay. Thank you, Mr.
President. Best of luck to you in the fu-
ture, and I hope you are here for an-
other 8 years.
THE PRESIDENT. Thank you very
much.
I might say, Walter, there's a Mr. Otto
Flaig of Milwaukee, Wisconsin. His tele-
phone number, unfortunately for him
today, is 242-1611, and ever since 6
o'clock this morning he has been getting
calls from people who want to talk to me.
He has requested me to announce that
people please dial the 1 and then the 900
before they dial the 242-1611, so his
phone will quit ringing.
MR. CRONKITE. I assume those calls
could only get to him from the Milwau-
kee area, and if they once dial the 900,
it won't get through to him at all.
THE PRESIDENT. That's true. I'd like
to ask people-I guess there are other
folks around the country that got the
same last seven numbers. So, everybody
ought to remember to dial the 900 before
the 7.
MR. CRONKITE. I wonder if that gen-
tleman in Milwaukee is giving them any
answers. Maybe he is giving them quite
satisfactory solutions to their problems.
THE PRESIDENT. I am sure he is get-
ting a lot of questions. His answers are
probably better than mine.
MR. CRONKITE. We have a call from
Lapeer, Michigan, from Ms. Colleen
Muir, I believe it is.
Muir, is it?
MS. MUIR. Muir.
MR. CRONKITE. She's 16 years old, I
am told, Mr. President.
Go ahead, Ms. Muir.
Ms. MUIR. Good afternoon, Mr. Pres-
ident, and thank you for this opportunity
to talk to you.
THE PRESIDENT. Thank you, Colleen.
MILITARY AND PUBLIC SERVICE
Ms. MUIR. I was wondering, since the
volunteer draft program isn't working
too well, that you would put a draft sys-
tem into effect; and, if you would, would
you draft women the same as men as the
equal rights amendment infers?
THE PRESIDENT. Well, Colleen, we
don't have any plans now to put in a
draft system. So far we are still getting by
with the voluntary armed forces.
The major problem has been in the re-
serves. We are about 800,000 people
short, I believe, now in reserve recruit-
ment. The regular armed forces are hold-
ing their own.
But if I see it is necessary in the future
to initiate a draft, then I would certainly
recommend to the Congress that this be
done.
I would like to combine it with a much
more comprehensive public service op-
portunity where people might go into
jobs like the Peace Corps or VISTA,
teachers' aides or mental institutions and
so forth, along with military training as
well.
I would make it much more all-inclu-
sive than it has been in the past. I would
not, for instance, exclude college students.
And if it becomes necessary for national
security, the likelihood is that women
would be included as well. But I'd like to
draw a distinction between military serv-
ice and other service that would benefit
our country just as much in a time of need
or crisis.
