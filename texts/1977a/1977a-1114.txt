United States Conference of
Mayors
Remarks by Telephone to the Opening Session
of the Conference. June 13, 1977
THE PRESIDENT. First of all, to Mayor
Ken Gibson and to the distinguished
mayors who are at the conference in
Tucson, let me say that I wish I was there
with you.
Last year when the mayors were meet-
ing in Milwaukee, I was able to be there
to spell out in some detail what I hoped
to accomplish if I should become Presi-
dent. Now that I have a full-time job, it's
not as easy for me to attend as many con-
ferences. That's one reason I can't come,
particularly this year when we are trying
so hard to implement the campaign com-
mitments that I made with your support
and with your guidance to me.
I do have great confidence in the rep-
resentatives that are in Tucson with you
from my own administration. Patricia
Harris will be speaking to you at lunch
today, I understand. Jack Watson from
