Water Resource Projects
Announcement of Review
Procedures. March 23, 1977
Secretary of the Interior Cecil Andrus
and Secretary of the Army Clifford Alex-
ander, with the assistance of the Office of
Management and Budget and the Council
on Environmental Quality, have com-
pleted the water projects screening proc-
ess to determine which projects will not
undergo further review at this time and
will be funded in fiscal year 1978 and
which ones will be subject to additional
evaluation, including public hearings.
The criteria used in the screening proc-
ess took into account environmental im-
pacts, project benefits, project economics,
and safety factors.
As a result of the review process, 307 of
a total of 337 Corps of Engineers and
Bureau of Reclamation water resource de-
velopment projects will not undergo fur-
ther review at this time and will be
funded in the forthcoming fiscal year.
Three projects which were on the list
of 19 recommended for deletion in the
President's February 21 message to the
Congress have been dropped from further
study at this time-the Dickey Lincoln
School Lakes Project, in Maine; Paints-
ville Lake, in Kentucky; and Freeport, in
Illinois.
Dickey Lincoln, along with a number
of other projects, is still in the environ-
mental impact study phase. No project
which is still in the engineering and de-
sign or environmental study phase will be
subject to further study by the Presidential
review group at this time, since additional
work is needed to permit a full assessment
of benefits, economics, environmental im-
pacts, and safety features. Paintsville Lake
and Freeport passed through the screening
process without triggering major eco-
nomic, environmental, or safety concerns
under the criteria used.

will not undergo further review follows:
