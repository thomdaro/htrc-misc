Administration of Jimmy Carter, 1977
May 26
But over a period of months, as Com-
mander in Chief of the Armed Forces, I
need to know about our defense capabili-
ties, and one of the best ways to get that
information is to visit in person some of
the military bases and installations.
Q. Mr. President, once again you didn't
get beyond the fourth row this time. I've
got a question about the month of May.
About a month ago, you declared May
a time to remember the problems of the
elderly, and I've got a couple of questions
I've been trying for the last three press
conferences to ask you.
THE PRESIDENT. Why don't
you wait
until the next press conference, and if
you'll remind Jody, I'll try to call on you.
Q. All right. Fine.
Q. Mr. President, that submarine can
carry cruise missiles. Could you talk to us
a little bit about the cruise missile?
THE PRESIDENT. Not now, Marilyn
[Marilyn Berger, NBC News].
Q. Mr. President, one thing was left
unclear. Aviation News reported that you
are considering a moratorium on cruise;
is that accurate?
THE PRESIDENT. No.
Q. Mr. President, you are tying yourself
more and more tightly to balancing the
budget, and it may be a goal that has
factors that you can't afford. How come
you keep locking yourself more and more
tightly into it?
THE PRESIDENT. I'm not-not any
tighter than I have been.
