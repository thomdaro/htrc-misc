for the deleted projects amount to $289
million. Total potential savings from these
deleted projects would amount to $5.1
billion.
I look forward to working closely with
Congress to develop a coherent water re-
source policy.
We must work together to achieve our
national goals of adequate water supplies,
a sound transportation system and needed
flood protection. In doing so, we must
make certain that our investments are
cost-effective, that the cost burdens are
equitably borne, and that the environment
is protected.

Visit of Prime Minister Pierre
Elliott Trudeau of Canada
Remarks of the President and the Prime
Minister at the Welcoming Ceremony.
February 21, 1977
THE PRESIDENT. To Prime Minister Tru-
deau and his beautiful wife, Margaret, to
the people of Canada who come to be
with us this afternoon, and to all of our
own welcomers who have come here on
this occasion to make our neighbors feel
at home:
I am very grateful to be here, to wel-
come to the White House and to our
country a man who shares with me the
tremendous friendship that has always
existed between the United States of
America and the people of Canada to the
north.
We share a common border, more than
5,000 miles. We share a common defense
of our own people. We share the human
and natural resources of an entire con-
tinent. We share a great respect and
friendship for each other. We share a
commitment to human decency and to
personal freedom. We share a historical
belief in the principles of democracy, and
these principles have been tangibly dem-
onstrated by our Governments for gen-
erations. And we share a common com-
mitment to world peace.
Canada is our most important trade
partner. We have many common purposes
and common concerns, common prob-
lems, and also the potential for common
solutions to those problems. This next 2
days I will spend with Prime Minister
Trudeau, and he will have a chance to
visit with our top officials and to let the
Canadian officials share these discussions.
We will be talking about defense and
peace. We will be talking about the world
