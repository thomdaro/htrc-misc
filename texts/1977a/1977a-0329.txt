Administration of Jimmy Carter, 1977
Mar. 5
But I might reemphasize that at this
time we have no intention of going to a
draft.
Ms. MUIR. Okay, thank you.
MR. CRONKITE. Thank you, Ms. Muir.
From Jerry Wildman, the next call,
Mr. President. He's in Lake Worth,
Florida.
MR. WILDMAN. That's Wildman, Mr.
Cronkite.
MR. CRONKITE. All right.
MR. WILDMAN. Good afternoon, Mr.
President.
THE PRESIDENT.
PRESIDENT. Good afternoon,
Jerry.
UGANDA
MR. WILDMAN. Before I get to my ques-
tion, I would just like to add that I am a
candidate for the U.S. Naval Academy,
and I hope to follow along in your foot-
steps.
Now, to my question, I would like to
know what actions would be taken if any
hostile acts were taken against American
or allied citizens living in Uganda.
THE PRESIDENT. That was a question
earlier on the program, Jerry. I might just
say that we had this question come up
last
weekend. We tried to handle it in a very
unpublicized and careful way, knowing
the unpredictability of Idi Amin.
I just let him know very forcefully and
frankly that we were concerned about
American citizens. And we also got other
nations, who have the communications
and the understanding of Amin better
than we do, to deal with him and to help
us there.
I understand from the news that about
8 or 10 different foreign leaders, mostly
from the Moslem countries, contacted
Amin. The West Germans helped us a
great deal, and the crisis was averted.
But I would guess if this should reoccur
in the future-and I hope it won't that
we'll handle it in the same way, Jerry.
MR. WILDMAN. I see. Well, thank you
very much, Mr. President.
THE PRESIDENT. Thank you, sir.
MR. CRONKITE. The next question is
from Samuel Rankin of Billings, Mon-
tana, Mr. President.
MR. RANKIN. Good afternoon, Mr.
President.
THE PRESIDENT. Good afternoon, Sam.
HEALTH CARE; VIETNAM
MR. RANKIN. I have a two-part ques-
tion. The first is broken into two minor
economic questions. I hope that this has
not been covered previously. If it has,
maybe you would like to add some things
that possibly you didn't get to add in the
previous questions.
I would like your commitment and your
comments on a resolution in the public's
favor that would alleviate the painfully
high cost of medical care in the U.S. And
I know also that these two are relatedâ€”a
total commitment to the lowering of the
transfer payments, which I believe are
your 46 percent of the income derived by
the Government from corporate and in-
dividual taxes.
THE PRESIDENT. Mr. Rankin, I don't
know any way to answer your question
very well at this point. I might say that
these are two questions that we're work-
ing on simultaneously. The income tax
changes are part of the transfer of pay-
ments. Also, the welfare system in its
entirety needs to be reformed.
By the first of May, Joe Califano, who is
the new Secretary of HEW, working with
literally hundreds of different people, will
come up for me and for the Congress with
a comprehensive reform of the welfare
system. It will be, I would say, next year
before we can complete an adequate
analysis of the health care system as a
whole.
