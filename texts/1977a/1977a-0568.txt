Apr. 1
Administration of Jimmy Carter, 1977
I am also ordering the Secretaries of
Commerce and Labor and the Special
Trade Representative to conduct a full
review of the Government's trade adjust-
ment assistance programs. This review
will examine the means by which Govern-
ment can encourage the revitalization of
trade-impacted industries through tech-
nological support and guidance, data and
market research, and marketing and pro-
motion services.
The review should also focus on the
improvements in the administration and
organization of adjustment assistance;
the removal of impediments to effective
adjustment assistance that can be accom-
plished under existing law; and the explo-
ration of new legislative initiatives. With-
in the next 90 days, I will present a
comprehensive trade adjustment assist-
ance program, including any legislation
which may be warranted.
This effort will require your Depart-
ment or Agency's full cooperation and
support if effective proposals are to be
developed.
