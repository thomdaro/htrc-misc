Mar. 5
Administration of Jimmy Carter, 1977
THE PRESIDENT. What was the first
part of that? I heard the 1976 income tax
revision. What's the first part?
MR. ROCHE. The sick leave portion of
the 1976 income tax revision.
MR. ROCHE. Tooele.
MR. CRONKITE.
Thank
-Utah.
you very much, Roches; glad to
talk to both of you.
THE PRESIDENT. I'll call you back per-
THE PRESIDENT. Yes, I am fairly fa- sonally on Monday and talk to you about
miliar with it.
MR. ROCHE. Well, my question is this,
Mr. President, of those that can't qualify
for their Federal medical retirement
now, could they possibly be given their
jobs back?
THE PRESIDENT. I don't know.
MR. ROCHE. The 1976 income tax
revision changed the agreement to which
these people retired at. And by changing
the agreements, people making $300 or
$400 a month are going to have to come
up with $400, $500, $600 for their 1976
income tax, due to the retroactive clause
in the sick leave portion.
THE PRESIDENT. Mr. Roche, perhaps
Walter could answer that question. I
don't know. But I'll have my staff see if I
can get the answer. If I can't give it to
you on this program, I'll give you a call
Monday and try to answer your question.
MRS. ROCHE. That would be great,
but, Mr. President-
THE PRESIDENT. Yes, ma'am.
MRS. ROCHE. If we would be allowed,
the truly disabled ones were allowed up to
$100 a week tax deduction, if they were
truly disabled, even though they are truly
disabled now, this new revision has taken
away that exclusion.
MR. CRONKITE. I gather that is Mrs.
Roche, it it?
MR. ROCHE. That's the boss.
MR. CRONKITE. Well, I tell you, the
President is going to look up this question
for
you. It's a rather complicated one. He
is going to see if he can get an answer for
you and get back to you. The question is
almost as difficult as pronouncing
Tooele
it.
MR. CRONKITE. Now, Mr. Charles
Stone, Mr. President, of Dallas, Texas. I
can pronounce both of those names, Stone
and Dallas.
INCOME TAX; HOUSING
MR. STONE. Two questions, sir. Having
recently completed figuring the income
tax for my fiancee and myself, the tax
difference was $1,000 between single and
married. When and what action do you
plan to take?
Also, in the news you recently stated
that the cost of a new home is out of reach
to most Americans. Is there anything that
can be done about the price or the interest
rates?
THE PRESIDENT. Mr. Stone, the only
thing that I know of that can cut down on
the price of interest rates would be to con-
trol inflation. And we have been working
for the last 6 weeks on a comprehensive
approach so that we will know in Wash-
ington and so that the American people
can be informed about all the things that
we do that cause an increase in interest
rates.
In addition, for low-income families or
middle-income families, we are trying to
stimulate housing construction by helping
with the repayment of your mortgage on
a monthly basis.
I hope to increase the amount of guar-
anteed loans for people like yourselves,
and I hope that this will be of help to you
in the years to come.
We've increased the authorization for
home construction by between $8 billion
and $9 billion which is an awful lot of
310
