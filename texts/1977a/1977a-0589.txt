of public importance involving the
government.
Second, I support legislation which will
give citizens broader standing to initiate
suits against the government, in appro-
priate cases. The government has too
often routinely invoked the "standing"
defense when it is challenged in court.
The Department of Justice will work
with my Special Assistant for Consumer
Affairs, Esther Peterson, and with the
Congress toward legislation to reform
this practice.
Third, I support the effort to enable
consumers to sue as a class to enforce
their rights. Recent court decisions have
greatly restricted their ability to do so. I
want to expand the opportunities for re-
sponsible class actions, starting with vio-
lations of consumers' rights. The Depart-
ment of Justice and Mrs. Peterson will
work with the Congress to develop suit-
able legislation.
These measures-and the others which
members of my Administration will dis-
cuss in the months aheadâ€”will enhance
the consumer's influence within the gov-
ernment without creating another un-
wieldy bureaucracy. I believe they will
increase confidence in government by
demonstrating that government is con-
sidering the people's needs in a sensitive
and responsive way.
