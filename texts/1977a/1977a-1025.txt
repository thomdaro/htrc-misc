Administration of Jimmy Carter, 1977
May 24
chance to meet with Prince Saud, who is
a foreign minister. And I think that was
a much more productive arrangement
than we've had in the past.
Q. [Inaudible]
THE PRESIDENT. But we discussed a
wide range of issues, including future oil
pricing prospects and the interrelation-
ships between the OPEC nations and the
countries in Africa. We discussed the
Horn of Africa and how to keep the Red
Sea region peaceful. We discussed the
hopes or possibilities for a Middle Eastern
peace settlement this year. We had a long
discussion about our own involvement in
this process.
I think that we understand each other
very well. And so far as I know, between
ourselves and Saudi Arabia there are no
disturbing differences at all. So, I think
that I have benefited greatly from those
meetings.
The Crown Prince will now meet with
the Senate Committees on Energy and
Foreign Relations and also with the
House Committees. And I think that his
total visit here has been one that's very
productive.
Q. What did you agree on on oil prices?
Q. What did he say about the oil
prices?
THE PRESIDENT. I would have to let
him make comments on that.
Q. [Inaudible]
THE PRESIDENT. Just pleasure at the
progress that has been made there within
the last 12 months.
Q. Was there ever any mention of the
threatened embargo which we heard
about last weekend?
THE PRESIDENT. No, there's no threat-
ened embargo at all. He said that was a
completely false report.
Q. What did he ask you to say to Israel?
THE PRESIDENT. Just to continue a
search for peace and keep the process
alive to make sure that no one closes the
door for a settlement that would provide
a just and lasting peace. He also expressed
his strong hope that Israel would be reas-
sured about the inclinations of his coun-
try towards the protection of their
security. These were the comments that
he made concerning about his view
Q. Do you feel he expects you to pres-
sure Israel in any way?
THE PRESIDENT. I think not. I think
it's obvious that we have some influence
in Israel and also the Arab countries. But
we also, obviously, have no control
over-
Q. Do you think that Begin would close
the door?
THE PRESIDENT. I think he shares my
views that it's too early to comment on
the future policies of the new government.
No one knows the composition of it yet.
And I think it would be premature to
comment.
Q. In your public statements so far you
haven't mentioned the 1977 Geneva con-
ference possibilities or a Palestinian
homeland.
Q. He mentioned it yesterday at the
hand-out.
Q. Not publicly.
Q. That's a public hand-out. It was
placed right in your hand.
Q. Are you going to visit us in the Mid-
dle East, Mr. President, this year?
THE PRESIDENT. Well, some day, I
hope. I'm not much on foreign travel. I
don't know.
Q. After each one of these meetings you
usually think you are more optimistic or
less. What is your impression now?
THE PRESIDENT. Well, it's hard to tell.
I think a lot of the uncertainty there is
involved in the recent election results in
Israel. There's no way to predict what the
formation of the government might be
