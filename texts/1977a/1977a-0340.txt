Mar. 5
Administration of Jimmy Carter, 1977
THE PRESIDENT. Did you get a chance
to come?
AMY CARTER
MISS STANLEY. No, I didn't, but I was
just happy to get it. And I have another
question. Why doesn't Amy go to a pri-
vate school?
THE PRESIDENT. Well, I hope sometime
perhaps, Michelle, you can come and visit
with Amy.
MISS STANLEY. Sure.
THE PRESIDENT. She goes to the public
school and did in Georgia when we lived
there as well. She enjoys it very much, and
I have a very strong commitment to the
public school system and don't have any-
thing against the private school system.
But I think it helps the public schools in
Washington, D.C., to have the President's
daughter go there. And it indicates to
other parents that I have confidence in the
public school system all over the country.
Amy goes to school with children, I
think, from 26 foreign nations as well as
our own country. And so far she likes the
school very much.
So, because of my commitment to the
public school and because Amy likes it,
those are the reasons, Michelle. Good luck
to you.
OTTAWA INDIAN LAND SALE
I might say, Walter, that I've got an
answer to Mrs. John Ritchey's question
about the payment for the Ottawa In-
dians' lands. This bill has already been
signed into law. And there are $10.2 mil-
lion to be distributed to the members of
the Ottawa tribe. The Department of In-
terior is right now writing rules for the
distribution of the funds, and by late sum-
mer of this year, the money will be dis-
tributed. So, that ought to be good news
to Mrs. John Ritchey of Georgetown,
Kentucky.
MR. CRONKITE. Mr. President, you got
the answer there for her just in time be-
cause we have just about run out of time.
I am just curious, Mr. President, before
we close this off today, what you thought
of the questions you got in this first experi-
ment in meeting the people through a
telephone call-in broadcast.
THE PRESIDENT. Walter, I liked it. The
questions that come in from people all
over the country are the kind that you
would never get in a press conference.
The news people would never raise them,
like the Ottawa Indian question. And I
think it's very good for me to understand
directly from the American people what
they are concerned about and questions
that have never been asked of me and re-
ported through the news media.
So, my inclination would be to do this
again in the future. And I'll wait and see
how the American people react to it, to
see whether or not I have done a good
job to make it worth their while.
But I want to thank you for being here
with me this afternoon. The 2 hours
passed very quickly, and I've enjoyed it
and learned a lot from it.
MR. CRONKITE. I think they did, in-
deed, and we'd be glad to sign you up
again, Mr. President.
THE PRESIDENT. Good deal.
MR. CRONKITE. We have run out of
time. We thank you for your time and
the cooperation of your entire staff in
making this broadcast possible.
We
regret such a small number of those
who wanted to talk with you actually did
call i.. and
of
many
who did call and
you
didn't get through to the President, we
apologize for that.
Our special thanks to all of you who
were interested in this new broadcast idea
and for President Carter and me in the
Oval Office of the White House, good
afternoon.
