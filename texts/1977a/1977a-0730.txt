Prayer for Peace, Memorial Day,
May 30, 1977
Proclamation 4504. April 25, 1977
By the President of the United States
of America
A Proclamation
The greatest honor we can pay those
who have given their lives in our Nation's
defense is to serve the ideals for which
they died.
We properly honor these men and
women on Memorial Day-as we honor
those who fought and lived, to continue
the struggle for peace, freedom, justice,
and human rights.
Let us remember on Memorial Day
those who have lived and died in pursuit
of a just peace. Let us pray that, like them,
we will leave behind us a stronger Nation
and a better world.
In tribute to those Americans who have
died for their country, and to those who
survived to carry on their unfinished work,
the Congress, by joint resolution of May
11, 1950 (64 Stat. 158), has requested the
President to issue a proclamation calling
upon the American people to observe each
Memorial Day as a day of prayer for per-
manent peace.
Now, THEREFORE, I, JIMMY CARTER,
President of the United States of America,
do hereby designate Memorial Day, Mon-
day, May 30, 1977, as a day of prayer for
permanent peace, and I designate the
hour beginning in each locality at 11
o'clock in the morning of that day as a
time to unite in prayer.
I urge the press, radio, television, and
all other information media to join in this
observance.
I call upon the appropriate officials of
all levels of government to fly the flag at
half-staff until noon during Memorial
Day on all buildings, grounds, and naval
vessels throughout the United States and
in all areas under its jurisdiction and con-
trol. I request the people of the United
States to display the flag at half-staff from
their homes for the same customary fore-
noon period.
IN WITNESS WHEREOF, I have hereun-
to set my hand this twenty-fifth day of
April, in the year of our Lord nineteen
hundred seventy-seven, and of the Inde-
pendence of the United States of America
the two hundred and first.
Those of us who survived the battle, or
who never had to bear it, must work to
assure that no American will ever be asked
to offer up his or her life in war unless the

survival of our Nation or of democracy [Filed with the Office of the Federal Register,
itself is at stake.
