Mother's Day, 1977
Proclamation 4503. April 21, 1977
By the President of the United States
of America
A Proclamation
Recent shifts in our culture and society
have created new patterns of life for many
American mothers and families.
Some of these changes have been desir-
able, and some not so desirable. But all
have put new burdens on the women who
must adapt to the shifts-the mothers of
America.
By and large they have met the chal-
lenge of change with grace, intelligence,
and dignity.
Mother's Day should no longer be
merely a day on which we reaffirm our
love for our mothers. It should also be an
occasion for admiration of the way
American mothers have maintained those
family bonds that protect us from the un-
certainties of a changing society and give
meaning and direction to our lives.
And it should be an occasion for those
of us in public life to reflect on what gov-
ernment can do to help the mothers of
America keep our families strong.
In recognition of the contributions of
all mothers to their families and to the
Nation, the Congress, by a joint resolution
approved May 8, 1914 (38 Stat. 770),
designated the second Sunday in May
each year as Mother's Day and requested
the President to call for its appropriate
observance.
President of the United States of America,
Now, THEREFORE, I, JIMMY CARTER,
do hereby request that Sunday, May 8,
1977, be observed as Mother's Day. I call
upon government officials to display the
flag of the United States on all govern-
ment buildings, and I urge all citizens to
display the flag at their homes and other
suitable places on that day.
IN WITNESS WHEREOF, I have here-
unto set my hand this 21st day of April,
in the year of our Lord nineteen hundred
seventy-seven, and of the Independence of
the United States of America the two
hundred and first.
JIMMY CARTER
