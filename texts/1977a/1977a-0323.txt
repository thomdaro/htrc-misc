COFFEE PRICES
MR. BUTKOVITZ. Yes, good afternoon,
Mr. President.
THE PRESIDENT. Good afternoon,
Dale.
MR. BUTKOVITZ. Yes, I have a ques-
tion here. This relates with the recent
coffee situation. My question is, can we
see any prospect of lower imported com-
modities on-such as coffee, and if so,
how can we go about this?
THE PRESIDENT. Is your name pro-
nounced Butkovitz or Butkovitz?
MR. BUTKOVITZ. Butkovitz, Mr. Presi-
dent.
THE PRESIDENT. Butkovitz.
I don't know how to answer your ques-
tion about the future. As you know, the
Brazilians and other coffee-producing
countries claim that the drought-or
freeze I think it was destroyed a num-
ber of coffee trees and that's the reason
for the high prices.
I think there are adequate reserves on
hand now. But the future crops of coffee
are likely to be very short, and the pros-
pect of shortages have forced up the price.
I don't know how to deal with this.
There is no way for us to control the
price of coffee that comes in from Colom-
bia or Brazil or Costa Rica to our own
Nation.
I think that we have one opportunity
as consumers, and that is to drink less cof-
fee as the price goes up. This is almost in-
evitable in a free enterprise system.
I'm here now for 2 hours without mov-
ing, and just coincidentally, I am drink-
ing hot tea now instead of coffee.
I don't want us to put up an embargo
on coffee use, but I don't know how to
answer your question any better than
that. I don't know what the future holds.
I don't think that we can do anything to
control the price of coffee except to re-
duce consumption.
MR. BUTKOVITZ. Mr. President?
THE PRESIDENT. Yes, Dale.
MR. BUTKOVITZ. God bless you, and I
wish you all continued success. You're do-
ing a fine job.
THE PRESIDENT. Thank you very
much, Dale. That's nice of you.
MR. CRONKITE. We're going to pause
now briefly in this CBS News special
broadcast, "Ask President Carter," to
give our stations 5 seconds to identify
themselves.
This is the CBS Radio Network.
This is "Ask President Carter," an ex-
periment in communication between the
President and the people of the United
States.
Now, let's go over the ground rules
again. The toll free number is 900–242–
1611. CBS operators will take your call.
They'll verify it, and they'll call you back
to put you on with the President.
We want to hear from just as many of
you as possible, so please do get your
question promptly when you get on the
line.
Mr. President, let's take another call.
It is from Mr. Phillip Roche Tooele of—
or it's Mr. Phillip Roche of Tooele, Utah.
THE PRESIDENT. Very good.
MR. CRONKITE. Let's go through this
once more, Mr. President. We might as
well spend the afternoon with this. Mr.
Roche of Tooele, Utah.
MR. ROCHE. That's Tooele.
MR. CRONKITE. All right, thank you,
sir. It is Roche, though, isn't it?
MR. ROCHE. It is Roche.
THE PRESIDENT. Phillip, go ahead with
your question.
SICK PAY
MR. ROCHE. Mr. President, are you
familiar with the sick leave portion of the
1976 income tax revision?
