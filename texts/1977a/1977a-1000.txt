Administration of Jimmy Carter,. 1977
give state and local areas more influence
over federal actions which affect them.
My Administration will also promote
better cooperation between government
and industry to solve some of our serious
remaining pollution problems. I have di-
rected the Administrator of the Environ-
mental Protection Agency to meet with
representatives of major industrial groups
and develop a joint government-industry
research program for unsolved pollution
problems.
Finally, my Administration will support
efforts to lower the barriers, financial and
otherwise, against active public involve-
ment in decisions that affect the quality
of the environment. The surest way to
sustain our environmental laws is to en-
courage citizens to hold the government
accountable for enforcing and obeying
them.
