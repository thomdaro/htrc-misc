Foreword
These papers have been collected to provide both a contemporary reference
source and a permanent historical record of the first months of my administration.
They indicate the breadth and scope of the domestic responsibilities with
which the American people expected their Federal Government to deal in 1977â€”
ranging from the immediate need to mitigate the tragic human effects of natural
disasters, to the need to overcome such continuing social problems as unemploy-
ment, inflation, welfare, and health care, to the need to re-examine our most basic
social attitudes toward energy and the environment. They also indicate the com-
plexity and delicacy of our international responsibilities in a world that has changed
dramatically within a single generation.
If there is much here that is routine, there is also much that suggests the
presence of a new spirit and a new dedication, a determination to confront directly,
and without pretense, the many hard issues that a democratic society must resolve.
One who has been so close to these events should not volunteer too quickly to
interpret them. Future historians will judge which of these documents are signifi-
cant, and for what reasons. But I know what I hope they will find-that, at home,
our government began to be less exalted and remote, more approachable and
compassionate; and that abroad, America began to restore the humane ideals and
nobility of purpose which rightfully make it an example for mankind. This would
be proof, not that leaders can transform a nation, but rather that the American
people do indeed have a fresh faith in the old dream.
