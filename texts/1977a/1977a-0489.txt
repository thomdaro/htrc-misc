Administration of Jimmy Carter, 1977
Mar. 22
Ill., to be Secretary of the Air Force. Stet-
son is president of the A. B. Dick Co., in
Chicago.
He was born in Chicago on Septem-
ber 6, 1920. He received a B.S. degree in
aeronautical engineering from Massachu-
setts Institute of Technology in 1943.
Stetson was a design engineer for the
Douglas Aircraft Co. in 1943 and 1944.
In 1944 and 1945, he served as an ensign
in the U.S. Navy. In 1945 and 1946, he
was a design engineer for Republic Box
Co.
From 1946 to 1948, Stetson worked for
George T. Schmidt, Inc., as a design and
sales engineer. He was sales manager for
Foote Brothers Gear & Machine from
1948 to 1951.
From 1951 to 1963, Stetson was a part-
ner in the Chicago consulting firm of
Booz, Allen & Hamilton. He served as
executive vice president and president of
the Newspaper Division of the Houston
Post Co. from 1963 until 1970, when he
became president of A. B. Dick.
The President also announced that he
has approved an exception to the conflict
of interest guidelines for Stetson.
Stetson is presently trustee of the John
C. Stetson 1968 trust. He has agreed to
name an independent trustee to serve in
his place while he serves as Secretary of
the Air Force.
The portfolio of that trust is well diver-
sified except that 63 percent is represented
by ownership of stock in the Mercantile
National Bank of Hammond, Ind., and
16 percent is represented by stock in the
Lansing Bank of Lansing, Ill.
The President has approved the excep-
tion because sale of the stock in these two
small banks would be difficult, and be-
cause Stetson's disqualifying himself from
acting on matters affecting their financial
interest would rarely, if ever, affect his
duties as Secretary of the Air Force, since
neither bank does any business with the
Department of Defense.
Small Business Administration
Nomination of A. Vernon Weaver, Jr., To Be
Administrator. March 22, 1977
The President today announced that
he will nominate A. Vernon Weaver, Jr.,
of Little Rock, Ark., to be Administrator
of the Small Business Administration.
Weaver is president of the Union Life
Insurance Co. in Little Rock.
He was born in Miami, Fla., on April
16, 1922. He attended the University of
Florida and the University of Miami and
graduated from the United States Naval
Academy in 1946.
Weaver served 2 years of sea duty in
the Navy and then spent 6 months at pho-
togrammetry school and 6 months in the
training group at the naval base at Guan-
tanamo Bay, Cuba. He resigned from the
Navy in 1949. He was recalled to active
duty in 1951 and served 2 years in the Of-
fice of Naval Intelligence at the Pentagon.
Following his resignation from the
Navy, Weaver worked for two small busi-
ness concerns in Miami prior to joining
Stephens, Inc., a large investment bank-
ing firm in Little Rock in 1961.
From 1962 to 1969, he worked at
Hollis & Co., a Stephens, Inc., subsidiary,
and Union Management Corp., a subsid-
iary of Union Life Insurance Co. (which
is an affiliate of Stephens, Inc.). In 1969
Union Life sold its two mutual funds to
Interscience Capital Management Corp.,
in New York, and Weaver worked there
for a year.
In February 1971, he rejoined Union
Life Insurance Co. as vice president, and
in January 1972 he became president.
