Presidential Advisory Board on
Ambassadorial Appointments
Announcement of Formation and Membership
of the Board. February 3, 1977
The President has invited a group of
20 Americans to constitute a Presidential
Advisory Board on Ambassadorial Ap-
pointments. The Board, which is com-
prised of persons with backgrounds vary-
ing from education to government and di-
plomacy, will examine the qualifications
of candidates under consideration for
certain ambassadorial posts. It will advise
the President and the Secretary of State,
in confidence, of its findings.
The work of the Board will help to en-
sure that only qualified individuals are
nominated by the President to serve as
American ambassadors abroad. The
Board will consider prospective nominees
for ambassadorial posts for which non-
career individuals are being considered.
The names of career Foreign Service of-
ficers as well as of prospective nominees
from outside the Service will be submitted
to the Board by the Secretary of State.
Governor Reubin Askew, of Florida,
will chair the Board. To ensure their ob-
jectivity, members of the Board will be
asked to agree not to accept appointment
to an ambassadorial post during their
service on the board, or for a period of
at least one year thereafter.
