May 10
Administration of Jimmy Carter, 1977
been completed in each of these three
fields.
That's all that happened that you
haven't already learned by reading the
President's speech, and I'm now open to
any questions.
QUESTIONS
NATO MINISTERIAL MEETING
Q. What were some of these quick ac-
tions that the Defense Ministers would
focus on?
AMBASSADOR
dent-
Q. Question?
OWEN. The Presi-
AMBASSADOR OWEN. The question
was: What were some of the quick ac-
tions that the Defense Ministers might
focus on? The President, in his speech,
didn't specify what they were, and I'd
be reluctant to try and do Harold Brown's
work for him, but I think generally you
could assume that they will be in fields
such as antiarmor, increased readiness, in-
creasing war reserves. These are three
areas in which I could conceive that quick
actions would be taken. But the specifica-
tion of that you'll have May 17, when
Harold Brown goes to the Defense Min-
isters meeting.
Q. What happens now? Will everybody
leave?
AMBASSADOR OWEN. No. There is a
second day of the meeting and the second
day of the meeting will do at least two
things: One is talk in more detail about
the Belgrade Conference, which was dis-
cussed today, but they'll talk about it
more intensively tomorrow; and secondly,
go over the communique and reach an
agreement on that, so that it can be is-
sued tomorrow. And the comunique will
be both addressed to the general questions
which NATO communiques always ad-
dress and presumably comment on the
President's three initiatives.
Q. Who will be at the table for us
tomorrow?
AMBASSADOR OWEN. Secretary Vance
will be there tomorrow, plus Ambassador
Bennett, our newly appointed Ambassa-
dor to NATO, who's with me here today.
Q. Did they agree, in principal, to the
Washington summit idea?
AMBASSADOR OWEN. I wouldn't say
people stood up and said, "Yes, yes, yes,"
but my general impression was that the
idea gained favor.
Q. Is this just a NATO summit?
AMBASSADOR OWEN. That is correct.
Q. On a political question, did the sub-
ject of civilian emergency come up?
AMBASSADOR OWEN. No. It did not.
Q. Will that come up tomorrow?
AMBASSADOR OWEN. I couldn't tell
you whether it will come up tomorrow.
Tap, do you know whether that will come
up tomorrow.?
MR. SCHECTER. Repeat the question,
please.
AMBASSADOR OWEN. The question was,
did civilian emergency measures, civilian
preparedness defense mobilization meas-
ures, was that discussed. It was not dis-
cussed today. The second question was
whether it will come up tomorrow, and
my answer was I don't know.
Then I remembered when I was in the
Navy they told me never say you don't
know. So, I asked Tap Bennett. Will it
come up tomorrow?
MR. BENNETT. It's open. It can.
AMBASSADOR OWEN. Tap says it's open.
It may. He said it can. But he meant it
may.
HUMAN RIGHTS
Q. Is there any reason why the refer-
ence to human rights was not in the pre-
pared text and was added afterwards by
the President?
AMBASSADOR OWEN. I think it's the
same question you might ask about each
