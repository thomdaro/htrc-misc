Exchange With Reporters on
Arrival. May 27, 1977
THE PRESIDENT. It is good to see you.
Q. Are you sure you don't want to have
a little pool with you, Mr. President?
THE PRESIDENT. It is not up to me, it is
up to the—I think—are we going to have
a small group going on board?
Q. We have five on now.
THE PRESIDENT. We have five on board
now.
Q. Really?
THE PRESIDENT. Yes.
Q. When was the last time you were on
a submarine, sir?
THE PRESIDENT. The last time I was on
a submarine was in Savannah, I guess 6
years ago. But we were not at sea. It was
just a visit alongside the dock.
The last time I was on board a subma-
rine at sea, I think, was in 1952. So, it has
been a long time.
Q. Mr. President, have you ever been
on a nuclear submarine?
THE PRESIDENT. No, I never have be-
fore. I worked on a nuclear submarine
program before the first one went to sea.
I was a senior officer in charge of the crew
that built the second submarine, the
U.S.S. Sea Wolf, but I left the Navy in
1953, in October.
The Nautilus and the Sea Wolf didn't
go out to operate until after I left the
Navy. So, I am looking forward to learn-
ing about it.
Admiral Rickover has been a very good
instructor for me, both back in the 1950's
and also in the 1970's. But I think we will
have a good day. When I come back I will
have a thorough briefing. I think we are
going to have news coverage from the air.
We will stay on the surface for an hour
and a half or 2 hours as we go out to the
hundred-fathom line. Then we will dive
from there.
Q. [Inaudible]
THE PRESIDENT. I am sorry?
Q. What are you holding?
THE PRESIDENT. It is just a light jacket
that I always wear on board a boat.
Q. Did you wear that when you were in
the Navy?
THE PRESIDENT. I haven't had it that
long. I don't-
Q. [Inaudible]
THE PRESIDENT. I think they are going
to do everything they can to show me how
the submarine works. I will have a report
when we come back.
Rex Granum will do several interviews
during the day with a tape and bring
those back. The reason for the press not
going out on the boat is that there are a
large number of items on the ship and
operating techniques that are highly classi-
fied. And they either have to cover all
those up or take some other actions just to
stay out of those compartments. That is
the reason for the press not going on
board.
Q. Mr. President, do you call this a
ship or a boat?
THE PRESIDENT. I'm sorry?
Q. What do you call this, a ship or a
boat?
THE PRESIDENT. Well, when I was in
submarines they called them ships. But
now they are five or six times larger so-
I mean they called them boats back then.
But now I think they call them ships.
Q. Admiral Rickover was selected to
serve as a submarine officer, and now he is
actually hosting you on board a nuclear
submarine.
