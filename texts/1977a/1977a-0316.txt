Mar. 5
Administration of Jimmy Carter, 1977
THE PRESIDENT. I might say, Walter,
that if I can't find the answer before we go
off the air, I will call Mike personally and
give him the answer, if I can.
MR. CRONKITE. Let's remind all of our
listeners out there the toll-free number to
reach the President here at the White
House is 900-242-1611. 900-242-1611.
Now, Mr. President, we have a young
man, 13 years old, I'm told, from Ridge-
crest, California, John Herold, who has a
question for you. John, go ahead.
MR. HEROLD. Good afternoon, Mr.
President:
THE PRESIDENT. Good afternoon, John.
How are things in California?
MR. HEROLD. Fine.
THE PRESIDENT. Good deal. What's
your question?
WESTERN DROUGHT
MR. HEROLD. Since the West is having
a drought and the East has too much.
snow, instead of shipping the snow in box-
cars to the South, why not ship it West?
THE PRESIDENT. Well, we're not ship-
ping snow south in boxcars. I think some-
body made a study of that, John, and
found that it would be too expensive to
try to ship snow to the West.
We are very concerned about your
drought, and I am not sure how far north
Ridgecrest is, but I know that there is an
appeal by your Governor not to waste
water.
And I believe that in the future, along
with energy conservation, we're going to
have to start worrying about water con-
servation.
We've had too much snow in the East.
Most of it has melted already, so we don't
have any snow to ship, even if it wasn't
very expensive.
That's a good thought, though, and it
was investigated quite thoroughly, I think,
a couple of weeks ago when Buffalo, for
instance, had accumulated about 4 or 5
feet of snow.
Good luck to you, John, and thanks for
calling in.
MR. HEROLD. Thank you.
MR. CRONKITE. The next call is from
Mrs. Helen Heller of Vineland, New
Jersey.
MRS. HELLER. Good afternoon, Mr.
President.
THE PRESIDENT. Good afternoon, Mrs.
Heller.
MEDICARE; HEALTH CARE COSTS
MRS. HELLER. Thank you for this op-
portunity to talk to you.
My question concerns the medicare
program. Does HEW have any plan to
reevaluate this program with the possi-
bility of extending benefits to senior citi-
zens so as to reimburse them for things
like needed dental care, eyeglasses, and/
or medications? The cost of these items
are so often beyond our fixed social se-
curity income, and yet they're vital neces-
sities to us.
THE PRESIDENT. Yes, ma'am. Those
things are all under consideration. We are
now in the process of reorganizing the in-
ternal structure of the Department of
Health, Education, and Welfare, so that
we can put the financing of health care
under one administrator. This will help a
great deal to cut down on the cost of
those items for people like yourself. Also,
we are freezing the amount of money that
you have to pay for medicare this coming
year, although the price of health care has
gone up about 15 percent a year the last
few years. We are trying to prevent your
monthly payments from going up for this
coming year.
MRS. HELLER. That is good.
THE PRESIDENT. Additionally, we have
introduced into the Congress a bill that
would hold down hospital costs and try
