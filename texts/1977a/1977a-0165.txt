Department of Defense
Nomination of Thomas B. Ross To Be an
Assistant Secretary. February 14, 1977
The President today announced his in-
tention to nominate Thomas B. Ross to
be an Assistant Secretary of Defense
(Public Affairs). Ross was previously
Washington bureau chief for the Chicago
Sun-Times.
He was born in New York City on Sep-
tember 2, 1929. He attended public ele-
mentary school and Fordham Preparatory
School in New York. He received a B.A.
degree in English from Yale University in
1951.
During and after the Korean war-
from 1951 to 1954-Ross served as a
naval officer, first on the U.S.S. Monterey,
a training carrier in Pensacola, Fla., and
then on the U.S.S. Hornet, an attack car-
rier in the Pacific.
He began his newspaper career in 1955
with the International News Service as its
State capitol reporter in Atlanta, Ga. In
1956 he ran the INS bureau in Hartford,
Conn., and in 1957 joined the Washing-
ton bureau, where he was assigned to the
Pentagon.
When INS merged with the United
Press in 1958, Ross worked briefly for
UPI, moving to the Chicago Sun-Times
later that year. From 1958 to 1968, he was
the newspaper's national security corre-
spondent, covering the Pentagon, the
State Department, and related agencies.
Between 1968 and 1970, Ross was a
foreign correspondent for the Sun-Times,
based first in Beirut and then in Paris. He
returned to the United States in 1970 to
become Washington bureau chief.
While with the Sun-Times, Ross cov-
ered most of the foreign trips of Presidents
Eisenhower, Kennedy, Johnson, Nixon,
and Ford, and of several Secretaries of
State and Defense.
He was a Nieman Fellow at Harvard
University in 1963-64. He is the coauthor
of three books: "The U-2 Affair” (1962),
"The Invisible Government" (1964), and
"The Espionage Establishment" (1967).
Ross married the former Gunilla
Ekstrand in 1963. They have three
daughters.
Visit of President López Portillo
of Mexico
Toasts of the President and
President López Portillo at a
Dinner Honoring the Mexican
President. February 14, 1977
PRESIDENT CARTER. A hundred years after
the University of Mexico was founded,
the pilgrims landed on Plymouth Rock,
and it was just shortly after the university
was begun that the first Spanish settlers
came to Georgia and to Florida and to
several other States in the deep South.
Because the history books were written
by historians from England, we don't re-
member the historical background of the
early Spanish-speaking settlers who meant
so much to our countries.
We declared our independence in 1776,
about 200 years ago, and shortly after
that, in 1810 the Mexican people declared
