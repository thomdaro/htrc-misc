National Energy Plan
Statement by the White House Press Secretary
Following Congressional Actions on Portions
of the Plan. June 10, 1977
I have some comments for you from
the President with regard to the energy
program.
The President feels that we have re-
ceived good cooperation from the Con-
gress thus far in speeding consideration of
the energy program. A number of pro-
posals have been tentatively, at least, ap-
proved. He would like to commend the
Senate for its actions yesterday on the
Clean Air Act.
However, the President is deeply con-
cerned about several recent actions. It is
his feeling that despite the efforts of
Chairmen Ullman, Dingell, and others on
behalf of the American public, yesterday
the oil companies and the automobile
companies and their lobbyists won signifi-
cant preliminary victories.
The President feels that the unneces-
sary action to deregulate natural gas is
particularly serious. That action, if it
finally becomes law, will cost the Ameri-
can consumers more than $80 billion dur-
ing the next 8 years.
The President considers that action to
be a direct and extremely serious devia-
tion from the basic fairness of the energy
plan. It is his hope and belief that the
full committee-that is, the commerce
committee and the Congress will reverse
this action.
He is also deeply concerned about early
actions of the House Ways and Means
Committee on several important elements
of the energy plan.
The President feels that it is important
to realize what the stakes are, that the
energy proposals are a comprehensive
package to help the Nation prepare, with
a maximum of foresight and a minimum
of dislocation, for inevitable shortages of
energy.
The President is eager to work with the
Congress, as he has in the past, to develop
solutions to this problem. However, it
should be noted that both the CBO, Con-
gressional Budget Office, and the GAO
[General Accounting Office] have indi-
cated that based on their figures, any
changes in the plan should strengthen it.
But actions taken yesterday threaten to
seriously weaken the overall energy effort.
These last few are the President's words
directly: "The people of this country will
be the ones to suffer if our hopes for an
energy plan are thwarted. They will be
the ones who will pay for yesterday's spe-
cial interest victories."
