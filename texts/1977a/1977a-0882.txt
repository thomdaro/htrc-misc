Administration of Jimmy Carter, 1977
really didn't change my opinion about
President Nixon. I personally think that
he did violate the law. I think he did com-
mit impeachable offenses. I think that he
doesn't think he did. And I noticed in the
post-program public opinion polls that
most of the people do agree with what
I've just said.
Q. We can't hear you back here.
Q. Mr. President, you did not believe
him, then?
THE PRESIDENT. Well, as I say, I think
he was guilty of impeachable offenses. But
I believe that he doesn't think he was. I
think he has rationalized in his own mind
that he did all these things for the benefit
of his staff members, and so forth, and
that he didn't have any criminal intent. I
think he's mistaken, but I'm sure it's pos-
sible for any human being to rationalize
their own actions, particularly in months
afterwards.
Q. Can you tell us about the sudden re-
surgence of Watergate interest in the
country? Why is the country suddenly in-
terested in this again?
THE PRESIDENT. Well, I think it's com-
pletely attributable to that series of tele-
vision programs.
Q. Do you think it's all right to go
ahead with them, and will you be watch-
ing "Foreign Policy" tonight, for example?
THE PRESIDENT. No, I won't.
Q. Why? Don't you think you will learn
anything from it?
THE PRESIDENT. No. I just have some
other things I've got to do. [Laughter]
Q. We ran into a lot of people who saw
the program in Great Britain. There
seemed to be a lot of interest in the Nixon
program. I just wondered, did any of the
other people that you met with mention it
at all or was there any talk about it?
THE PRESIDENT. Yes. Several of the
European leaders mentioned it. And I
would say that most of their comments
were deploring the resurrection of it.
Q. What do you mean, what he had to
say or that-
Q. The resurrection of Watergate?
THE PRESIDENT. Yes. It was quite a
blow to Europe, I think, to see our own
country besmirched with the Watergate
revelations, and I think they now are glad
to see it over and just did not want to see
the whole subject resurrected again. But I
don't think this is going to do any serious
damage.
Q. Didn't any of them tell you they
thought he was really just a victim of
politics?
THE PRESIDENT. No, they didn't.
Q. Were they critical of him for bring-
ing it up?
THE PRESIDENT. No, I don't think so.
They just deplored it. I don't mean that
they were
Q. He's making a lot of money off of it.
THE PRESIDENT. I know.
Q. Do you approve of that part of the
whole thing, of
Q. The selling of the ex-President-
Q. Selling of the Government?
THE PRESIDENT. Well, you know, I
don't want to get in the position of con-
demning Mr. Nixon for what he does now.
Q. Are you starting your memoirs?
[Laughter]
THE PRESIDENT. [Laughing] I don't
think anybody would pay for them.
Q. Did you get a taste for foreign travel
now, after you told us coming over you
didn't think much of traveling away from
Washington now? Now there is France,
Geneva.
Q. Paris.
Q. Did you get bitten by meeting with
the leaders of the free world?
THE PRESIDENT. I hope not. [Laughter]
Q. Did you feel like you were back on
the campaign up in Newcastle?
