Administration of Jimmy Carter, 1977
June 15
competent, just as intelligent as you are,
but this gives you a chance to go back with
a new vision of what our country is.
I'm glad that you have come to be with
us this afternoon. We have enjoyed being
here in the White House this first 5
months. I hope that what I have done has
opened up some of the difficult decisions
to public scrutiny, understanding, and de-
bate among our people.
I feel at ease with the job. I don't feel
that I know all the answers, but I do know
that I am constantly searching for an-
swers. And your advice and the support
that you might give me in the programs
with which you agree would be very
crucial.
So, when you get back home, tell the
folks that we've still got a good country,
we've got a good Government, it can be
better, and that you and I together are
trying to make it better.
Thank you very much for letting me be
with you.
NOTE: The President spoke at 1:30 p.m. on
the South Lawn of the White House before a
group of approximately 900 young people rep-
resenting rural electric systems in 24 States.
In his opening remarks, the President re-
ferred to Midge Costanza, Assistant to the
President for Public Liaison.
Alloy Tool Steel Imports
Proclamation 4509. June 15, 1977
MODIFICATION OF TEMPORARY QUANTI-
TATIVE LIMITATIONS ON THE IMPOR-
TATION INTO THE UNITED STATES OF
CERTAIN ARTICLES OF ALLOY TOOL
STEEL
By the President of the United States
A Proclamation
1. Proclamation No. 4445, of June 11,
1976, as modified by Proclamation No.
4477 of November 16, 1976, imposed
quantitative restrictions on the importa-
tion of certain articles of specialty steels.
Section 203 (h) (4) of the Trade Act of
1974 (the Trade Act) (19 U.S.C. 2253
(h) (4)) permits the President to reduce
or terminate any such restrictions if, after
taking into account advice received from
the United States International Trade
Commission (USITC) and after seeking
advice from the Secretaries of Commerce
and Labor, the President determines that
the reduction or termination is in the na-
tional interest.
2. I have sought and received advice
from the USITC and from the Secre-
taries of Commerce and Labor concern-
ing the effects of excluding alloy tool steel
provided for in item 923.25 of the Tariff
Schedules of the United States (TSUS)
from the quantitative restrictions imposed
by Proclamation No. 4445, as modified by
Proclamation No. 4477. I have deter-
mined, after considering that advice, that
the exclusion of alloy tool steel provided
for in item 923.25, TSUS, from such
quantitative restrictions is in the national
interest.
3. Accordingly, the purpose of this
proclamation is to terminate in part
Proclamation No. 4445 of June 11, 1976,
as modified by Proclamation No. 4477 of
November 16, 1976, so as to exclude alloy
tool steel provided for in item 923.25,
TSUS, from the present quantitative re-
strictions. The authority for this action is
set forth in section 203 (h) (4) (19 U.S.C.
2253 (h) (4)), and section 125 (b) (19
U.S.C. 2135(b)) of the Trade Act.
Now, THEREFORE, I, JIMMY CARTER,
President of the United States of America,
acting under the authority vested in me
by the Constitution and the statutes of the
United States, including sections 125 and
203 of the Trade Act (19 U.S.C. 2135
and 2253, respectively), do proclaim
that-
