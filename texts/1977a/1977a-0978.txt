Administration of Jimmy Carter, 1977
in meeting this problem. So again, thank
you, Mr. President.
Representative ULLMAN. Let me just
say that the stimulus package was the first
major package that the President sent up.
It involved, I think, a great deal of estab-
lishment of the proper relationship be-
tween the Congress and the President. It
demonstrated the President has flexibil-
ity in approaching the problems.
I think the net product is one that will
do the job that we intended to do and
one that has further significance in that
it, I think, establishes a pattern of a work-
ing relationship between the Congress
and the President that should be a proto-
type for a lot of other legislation coming
down the pike.
Thank you.
THE PRESIDENT. I want to thank all of
you personally for being so helpful and so
cooperative with me. This is a step in the
right direction. And I agree with Al's
statement. It's just a precursor of what
we're going to do together in the future.
NOTE: The President spoke at 11:33 a.m. at
