Administration of Jimmy Carter, 1977
Mar. 5
I might close my answer by saying that
in 1977, this year, there will be a com-
prehensive farm bill either passed or ex-
tended from the past number of years.
So, we'll be addressing this on a full-time
basis.
And Bob Bergland, who is a dirt farmer
from the northern part of Minnesota and
now the Secretary of Agriculture, I think,
will have a much better way to under-
stand both farmers and consumers than
has been done in the past.
MRS. SCHNUHL. Well, thank you so
much for your comments.
THE PRESIDENT. Thank you, Mrs.
Schnuhl.
MRS. SCHNUHL. Goodby.
THE PRESIDENT. Bye.
MR. CRONKITE. On the phone is Ms.
Rita Karatjas of Joliet, Illinois. Ms.
Karatjas, come ahead, please.
MS. KARATJAS. Good afternoon,
President Carter.
THE PRESIDENT. Good afternoon.
TAX REFORM
MS. KARATJAS. I would like to know
if you intend to remove the tax from
savings account interest and stock divi-
dends. I believe we're one of the only
countries in the world that tax unearned
income.
And I feel that as income is already
taxed at the payroll level, I feel it's very
unfair that it's taxed again after it's in-
vested or saved.
THE PRESIDENT. Ms. Karatjas, I can't
answer that question yet. I am not trying
to avoid your question. I just don't know
the answer.
MS. KARATJAS. I see.
THE PRESIDENT. That's one of the
things that we will be considering, along
with hundreds and hundreds of others in
the comprehensive tax reform study that
will be going on this year. So, I am re-
luctant now to single out one particular
part of the tax code and say it will not
be changed, even though it might very
well stay the same. I just can't answer
your question now.
MS. KARATJAS. I see.
THE PRESIDENT. I'm sorry.
Ms. KARATJAS. Thank you.
MR. CRONKITE. The next questioner,
Ronald Fouse, Centerville, Georgia. Mr.
President, Mr. Fouse.
MR. FOUSE. Good afternoon, Mr.
President.
THE PRESIDENT. Good afternoon, Mr.
Fouse. I came through Centerville the
last time I was home.
MR. FOUSE. Yes. You come through
the Air Force Base I work at every time
you come down.
THE PRESIDENT. Very fine. Go ahead
with your question.
VIETNAM ERA VETERANS
MR. FOUSE. Yes, sir. Now that you
pardoned the draft evaders and you pro-
pose to pardon the junkies and deserters,
do you propose to do anything for the
veterans such as myself that served the
country with loyalty?
THE PRESIDENT. Well, I thought I
might get a friendlier question from
Georgia, but I'll try to answer your ques-
tion.
I don't intend to pardon any more
people from the Vietnam era. I promised
the American people when I was running
for office that I would pardon the ones
who violated the selective service laws. I
don't have any apology to make about it,
and think I made the right decision. But
the deserters and others who have com-
mitted crimes against
mitted crimes against military law or
civilian law will not be pardoned by me
on any sort of blanket basis. My prefer-
ence is to let the Defense Department
