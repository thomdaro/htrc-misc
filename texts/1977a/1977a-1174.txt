June 24
Administration of Jimmy Carter, 1977
representatives of member agencies of the
Trade Policy Staff Committee, may make
a determination that for the purposes of
section 203 (e) (3) of the Trade Act the
orderly marketing agreement does not
continue to be effective.
(b) With respect to the products of
Japan, beginning on July 1, 1977, the
Special Representative may direct the
Commissioner of Customs to restrict the
entry, or withdrawal from warehouse, for
consumption of articles subject to the or-
derly marketing agreement which are not
accompanied by a valid export certificate
showing authorization for export to the
United States pursuant to the provisions
of the agreement.
(c) With respect to the products of
Japan, entry, or withdrawal from ware-
house, for consumption of articles not ac-
companied by a valid export certificate
will be denied for the remainder of a re-
straint year should the total amount of
such articles entered, or withdrawn from
warehouse, for consumption in the United
States reach three percent of the level for
that restraint period specified in the
agreement.
(d) With respect to the products of
other countries, beginning on July 1,
1977, if the quantity of imports of all other
countries, excluding Japan, of the articles
subject to import relief under this procla-
mation appear likely during a 12 month
period to disrupt the effectiveness of the
orderly marketing agreement, the Special
Representative may initiate consultations
with those countries responsible for such
disruption and may prevent further en-
tries of such articles for the remainder of
the restraint period or otherwise moder-
ate or restrict the imports from such coun-
tries pursuant to section 203 (g) (2) of the
Trade Act, (19 U.S.C. 2253 (g) (2)).
Before exercising this authority, the Spe-
cial Representative shall consult with rep-
resentatives of the member agencies of the
Trade Policy Staff Committee.
(e) Should the Special Representative
determine to institute import restrictions
on articles entered, or withdrawn from
warehouse, for consumption from Japan
or from other countries pursuant to para-
graphs (2) and (4) (d) of this proclama-
tion, such action shall become effective
not less than eight days after such deter-
mination and any necessary changes in
the TSUS have been published in the
FEDERAL REGISTER.
(5) The Special Representative shall
take such actions and perform such func-
tions for the United States as may be nec-
essary concerning the administration,
implementation, modification, amend-
ment or termination of the agreement
described in paragraph (1) of this proc-
lamation and any actions and functions
necessary to implement paragraphs (2),
(3) and (4) of this proclamation. In
carrying out his responsibilities under this
paragraph the Special Representative is
authorized to delegate to appropriate of-
ficials or agencies of the United States
authority to perform any functions nec-
essary for the administration and imple-
mentation of the agreement or actions.
The Special Representative is authorized
to make any changes in Part 2 of the Ap-
pendix to the TSUS which may be nec-
essary to carry out the agreement or
actions. Any such changes in the agree-
ment shall be effective on or after their
publication in the FEDERAL Register.
(6) The Commissioner of Customs
shall take such actions as the Special Rep-
resentative shall determine are necessary
to carry out the agreement described in
paragraph (1) of this proclamation and
to implement any import relief pursuant
to paragraphs (2), (3) and (4) of this
proclamation, or any modification there-
of, with respect to the entry or withdrawal
