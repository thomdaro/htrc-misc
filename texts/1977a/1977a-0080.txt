Emergency Natural Gas Act
of 1977
Remarks on Signing S. 474 and Related
Documents. February 2, 1977
While I was Governor, I signed about,
I think, 2,500 bills. But this is my first
one to sign as President.
I want to thank, first of all, all the
distinguished leaders of the Congress be-
hind me who made possible the passage
of this important legislation.
We are now in the midst of a very
serious energy crisis brought about not so
much by the natural shortage of natural
gas, but an inability to distribute it where
it's needed in our country.
I asked the Congress just a few days
ago to give emergency powers to me and
to the Federal Power Commission and
others to provide some reasonable assur-
ance to the American people that natural
gas could be placed in our country where
it's needed most.
