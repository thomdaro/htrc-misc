Geneva, Switzerland
Remarks Upon Arrival at Cointrin
International Airport. May 9, 1977
First of all, I would like to say that I
am very delighted and proud to come for
the first time to the beautiful country of
Switzerland.
Because of the deep commitment of the
Swiss people over many generations, and
even centuries, to basic human freedoms,
to the pure and idealistic aspirations of
humankind, and because of the historical
independence and insistence upon the
principles of peace, all the nations of the
world have looked upon Geneva and
Switzerland as a place to dispel differ-
ences and to eliminate hatred and to
search for a better common ground on
which we can get along well with one
another.
I come here today from a meeting con-
cerning economics and the future of the
people of our world as we seek a full em-
ployment and a more stable life and a
more equal balance of prosperity. I am
meeting here today with one of the great
leaders in the Middle East, President
Asad of Syria. We feel that 1977 might
be a good year to move forward toward
permanent peace in that troubled region
of the world.
No one can think of a better place to
meet and to explore possibilities than this
beautiful city of Geneva. My first memory
of Geneva was as the homeland for the
search for permanent peace, which didn't
last, in the League of Nations, and as a
birthplace of the Red Cross, and now as a
center for the common effort in the Euro-
pean theater for a mutual search for un-
derstanding and peace.
So, it's with a great deal of hope and
pleasure that I come to this beautiful
country. And I hope that later on this
year we might come back to find a reso-
lution of differences that have separated
one nation from another and one people
from another for many, many years in the
eastern Mediterranean area.
I want to thank these officials behind
me for having made me feel welcome.
Although my visit will be brief, I hope to
acquire here a better understanding of
the problems with which we might deal
later on this year. And I believe that the
natural inclination of the Swiss people
and the atmosphere and influence of Ge-
neva will be conducive to major progress
built upon this visit.
