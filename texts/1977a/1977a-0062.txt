* While the tax reduction will apply to the full year 1977 tax liability, withholding rates will
only be reduced for part of 1977, since passage of the law will come after the year is partly over. As

million workers who had dropped out of
the labor force because jobs are so hard
to find. The outgoing Council of Eco-
nomic Advisers conservatively estimated
that our economy operated in 1976 at ap-
proximately $132 billion below its high-
employment potential; every household in
our country lost approximately $1,800 per
year as a result. The nation lost approxi-
mately $35 billion in federal tax revenues
and approximately $10 billion in state and
local revenues because of inadequate eco-
nomic performance. Last year, expenses
caused by the recession-such as unem-
ployment compensationâ€”were $22 billion
higher than in 1973, the last pre-recession
year. Economic growth has declined for
three consecutive quarters. Most econo-
mists have projected that, without further
stimulus, the economy would grow by an
inadequate 42-5% in 1977. The severe
weather this winter will probably reduce
growth even further, if no action is taken.
A vigorous U.S. economy is vital to our
domestic welfare as well as to world sta-
bility and order.
In preparing this detailed economic
package I have been guided by several
principles:
A. Continuity and Consistency. Be-
cause we sought a sustained expansion in
consumer spending and business invest-
ment, we have developed a two-year pro-
gram, which will provide stimulus in both
this and the next fiscal year, and will also
