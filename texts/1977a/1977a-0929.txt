Administration of Jimmy Carter, 1977
May 17
Q. Thank you. Is there anything that
you heard today that you think might
cause you to change policy?
THE PRESIDENT. Well, I think some of
the questions about health care, for in-
stance, the pregnant women who are drug
addicts and the children who get-the
battered children-it's hard to know
where to place those particular programs.
Is it under the drug treatment program?
Is it under the health program? Is it a
comprehensive thing? Is it better to give
direct financial aid to local communities
and let them do it?
But I was impressed today with the
large number of questions that related
directly to health.

Q. Mr. President, we've been asked to
you go because you have to go look at

REPORTER. Mr. President, what did you
think?
THE PRESIDENT. I enjoyed it.
Q. Did you?
THE PRESIDENT. Yes.
Q. Did they ask good questions? It is
not really much you could do much about,
is it?
THE PRESIDENT. Well, a lot of their
questions are things that I can't know
about, like graffiti, you know, in some of
the California small towns. But it gives
me a good sense of what is of concern to
people.
I was impressed by the large number
of questions, for instance, about health
care.
Q. Would you consider those as
national?
THE PRESIDENT. Well, I would con-
sider it. We're just trying to probe around
for different ways to
Q. Do you think it would work on a
national basis?
THE PRESIDENT. I would think so. I
thought it worked well on the telephone
call-in. But it helps me to have the ques-
tions because we read them over very
carefully afterwards. We try to analyze
what's on people's minds. And this was a
wide range of subjects, all the
noticed, from energy questions to employ-
ment opportunities to health care.

Q. Anything in particular that you took
away from this today?
THE PRESIDENT. Just a feeling of
closeness.
Q. They're not shy about asking tough
questions, are they?
THE PRESIDENT. I noticed that.
Q. President Carter, do you plan any
more of these? This is your second one
now on radio and TV in a month and a
half. Do you plan more?
THE PRESIDENT. I think so.
Q. Thank you, sir.
