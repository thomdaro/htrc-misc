Administration of Jimmy Carter, 1977
and to 725,000 for fiscal year 1978. This
program would cost $0.7 billion in fiscal
year 1977 and $3.4 billion in fiscal year
1978 (Table 4).
This public service program will enable
the unemployed to use their talents to
serve their fellow citizens in hospitals, in
mental institutions, in improving our na-
tional parks, in recreation programs, in
rehabilitating those parts of our cities
where crime is high and hope is scarce,
and in energy-saving activities. We will
target our public service employment pro-
grams to areas of national need-such as
the improvement of our national parks,
and the insulation of homes and public
buildings as well as other energy-saving
activities.
b. Youth Training and Employment
Programs. Unemployment among
young people is far higher than the na-
tional average for workers of all ages, so
we must target specific programs to our
unemployed youth. I am proposing to ex-
pand the youth-oriented programs in
CETA, Titles III and V, by 176,000 slots
from 422,000 to 598,000 (Table 4).
The basic youth programs will be con-
ducted by the State and local governments
which are prime sponsors under CETA.
An additional program will be established
to take rural and urban young people aged
16 to 21 off of the streets and put them to
useful work helping to conserve, develop
and maintain our natural resources and
recreation areas. This, like the Civilian
Conservation Corps of 40 years ago, would
be a way to let young people serve their
Nation while expanding their own hori-
zons.
c. Vietnam-era Veterans. Military vet-
erans of the Vietnam-era deserve special
