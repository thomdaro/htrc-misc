United States-Cuba International
Fishery Agreement
Message to the Congress Transmitting
the Agreement. May 17, 1977
To the Congress of the United States:
In accordance with The Fishery Con-
servation and Management Act of 1976
(P.L. 94-265), I transmit herewith a
governing international fishery agreement
between the United States and Cuba,
signed at Havana on April 27, 1977.
This Agreement, one of a series to be
negotiated in accordance with that legis-
lation, is significant because it is the first
to be negotiated personally by representa-
tives of the two governments since 1958.
Favorable action by Congress on this
Agreement will constitute a tangible step
in the improvement of United States-
Cuban relations.
In that regard I note that the Fishery
Conservation and Management Act pro-
vides for 60 calendar days of continuous
session for review of the Agreement by
Congress. Since the Agreement in all ma-
terial respects is in accordance with the
provisions of the Act, I strongly recom-
mend that the Congress consider extend-
ing the provisions of the Fishery Conser-
vation Zone Transition Act (P.L. 95-6)
to this Agreement in order that it may be
brought into force at the earliest possible
date.
The White House,
