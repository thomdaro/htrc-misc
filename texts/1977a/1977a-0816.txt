National Nursing Home Week
Message of the President. May 5, 1977
I welcome the opportunity to salute the
dedicated individuals who serve institu-
tionalized older Americans and make
their golden years as pleasant and as dig-
nified as possible.
It is a priority task of my Administra-
tion to ensure that the contributions of
our aging citizens are fully recognized.
We must make certain that the great
benefits our nation has derived from
these contributions are acknowledged in
full measure by the quality of our concern
for those who made them.
As our knowledge increases and as we
become more fully aware of the needs of
the elderly, I know that those who minis-
ter to them will respond with sensitivity
and compassion to the challenges of their
important mission.
JIMMY CARTER
NOTE: National Nursing Home Week will be
observed May 8-15, 1977.
