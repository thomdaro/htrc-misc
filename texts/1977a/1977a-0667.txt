Administration of Jimmy Carter, 1977
Apr. 18
As with our energy problem, the corner-
stones of future water policy should be
wise management and conservation. Irri-
gation efficiency, water pricing, ground-
water management, and thoughtful land
use decisions will help institute lasting pro-
tection from drought and lessen the need
for expensive new water projects. Some of
the 32 projects would bring water to areas
where water use is not even metered and
where there are no State groundwater
management programs. And the General
Accounting Office has recently shown that
over half of the water delivered through
Bureau of Reclamation irrigation systems
is completely wasted. This is unacceptable.
5. Redirected public works program
The current heavy emphasis on expen-
sive water projects is counter to the need
for a more balanced public works program
providing jobs where they are needed the
most, at a cost we can afford, accomplish-
ing necessary work. Water projects pro-
vide more expensive jobs than other
government spending programs ($25,000
per job), and the current pattern of water
project distribution is contributing to the
Federal dollar drain out of the heavily
populated Northeast where economic
stimulus is needed. Many of our water
projects simply shift economic develop-
ment for no apparent policy reason. I
have proposed reforms in this area as part
of my economic stimulus program, and I
will also be developing suggested redirec-
tions for the Corps of Engineers and the
Bureau of Reclamation.
