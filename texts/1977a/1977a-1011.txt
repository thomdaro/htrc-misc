Genocide Convention
Message to the Senate Recommending
Ratification. May 23, 1977
To the Senate of the United States:
I am honored to have the privilege of
recommending to the Senate that it ap-
prove the Convention on the Prevention
and Punishment of the Crime of Geno-
cide. This Convention was initially
drafted in the wake of the wanton acts
committed by some of our enemies during
the Second World War. With the strong
support of the United States, the Conven-
tion was unanimously adopted by the
United Nations General Assembly on De-
cember 9, 1948.
The Convention, which now has 83
parties, provides that genocide consists of
acts intended to destroy a national, ethnic,
racial or religious groups as such. The
parties to the Convention undertake to
establish genocide as a criminal behavior
under their own legal systems.
The Convention thus protects the most
fundamental of all human rights-the
right to live-and it creates an essential
limit on the actions governments may ap-
propriately take with respect to the peo-
ple they govern.
The right to life was initially pro-
claimed for this nation in the Declaration
of Independence. The promise of the
Declaration was to protect that right by
instituting a new and democratic govern-
ment in America. Today it is important
that this nation assist the world commu-
nity to protect the right to life inter-
nationally.
The Genocide Convention has been
recommended by a succession of Presi-
dents, with specific endorsement by the
Departments of State, Defense and Jus-
tice. It also has the support of many of
our distinguished citizens and organiza-
tions, including the American Bar
Association.
I urge the Senate to give its advice and
consent to the ratification of the Conven-
tion. Ratification would be a significant
enhancement of the human rights com-
mitments of this nation, demonstrating
again to the world in concrete fashion our
determination to advance and protect
human rights.
The White House,
May 23, 1977.
