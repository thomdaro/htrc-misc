A Proclamation
A father watches his children grow
and shares their joys. He comforts them
through the many minor crises that are of
enormous significance to a child. But the
challenges of raising a child in an increas-
world re-
ingly complex and uncertain
quire more than just a desire to be a good
parent. A father must be ready to supply
the love, discipline, security and support
from which his children can draw
strength-even as he faces his own prob-
lems and concerns which are, for a time,
beyond their understanding.
