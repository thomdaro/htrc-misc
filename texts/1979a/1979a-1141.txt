Independence Day, 1979
Message of the President. June 21, 1979
We celebrate the Fourth of July as our
Independence Day, not because we had
achieved our independence on that day-
years of suffering and sacrifice would
pass before that was finally achieved-
but because it was the day when we de-
clared our irrevocable will for freedom.
Freedom and justice cannot be secured
permanently. They must be constantly
re-won in a thousand daily battles. The
great heritage we received from our fore-
fathers was not a perfected nation, but
the dream of a nation dedicated to the
fulfillment of the highest human ideals
and aspirations and the evidence of their
will and progress in making that dream
a reality.
That dream has caught fire in the
hearts of succeeding generations of
Americans and in the hearts of people
throughout the world. It is the strength
behind our power, the force that unites
and energizes us in the continuing strug-
gle to bring freedom and justice to all
people.
