Administration of Jimmy Carter, 1979
Meanwhile, the United States will con-
tinue to adhere to the International Ar-
rangement on Export Credits because it
remains a useful, if limited, instrument of
international discipline in the provision of
officially supported export credits. Within
this framework, the Export-Import Bank,
operating in consultation with the Na-
tional Advisory Council on International
Monetary and Financial Policy (NAC),
will provide the necessary export financ-
ing support to allow American exporters
to meet foreign official export credit com-
petition. For example, Eximbank will
continue its recently adopted policy of
matching mixed credits on a selective
basis, a policy which proved effective re-
cently when an American exporter was
awarded a contract based on an Exim-
bank financing package that matched the
mixed credit offer of a foreign govern-
ment.
Finally, in my FY 1980 budget, I have
asked the Congress for $4.1 billion in di-
rect lending authority for Eximbank, an
increase of $500 million from the FY 1979
budget. I have asked for this increase, to-
gether with $6.8 billion in insurance and
loan guarantee authority, in a year in
which I am determined to cut the Federal
budget deficit to below $30 billion. I ex-
pect the Bank to husband these new re-
sources carefully, but I also expect the
Bank aggressively to meet official export
credit competition.
The attached annex details the discus-
sions and the actions taken to improve the
International Arrangement and provide
competitive official export credit financ-
ing.
