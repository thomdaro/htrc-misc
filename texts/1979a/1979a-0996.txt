June 1
Administration of Jimmy Carter, 1979
Phased decontrol will increase domestic
production, reduce consumption, reduce
our vulnerability to foreign supplies, and
improve our balance of payments.
Phased decontrol will also mean a slight
increase in prices over the next few
years-although nothing like the large
increases we have already seen in the first
few months of this year, despite the old
system of controls.
OPEC-induced increases are likely to
continue whatever our decision on domes-
tic controls. Indeed, attempts to block
phased decontrol can only serve to en-
courge OPEC price increases and increase
our vulnerability to them.
The facts are that we have no choice in
problems will certainly grow worse and
our options fewer in the years to come.

from decontrol. The enactment of this
tax is essential, because its revenues will be
used to:
-Offset the increased prices due to de-
control for the poorest of our citizens;
-Increase our mass transit systems-
both buses and rail service;
-Increase our investment in research
and development for areas such as
solar power, better ways to burn and
use coal, substitutes for petroleum
and oil shale production.
The time has come to face facts. Our
energy problems are real. The time for
dreaming of easy, painless answers is past.
The time for rhetoric without responsi-
bility is past.
The difficulties we face this summer
could have been averted or substantially
lessened had we faced facts in years gone
by. If we fail to act responsibly now, our
