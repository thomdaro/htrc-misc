the statute and providing reasonable
adjustments where the effects of the
original provisions might have been
undesirable.
Enactment of this legislation would not
have been possible without the outstand-
ing leadership of Congressman George
Danielson, floor manager of the bill in the
House, and Senator Abe Ribicoff, floor
manager in the Senate. The legislation
received excellent cooperation on both
sides of the aisle in the House and the
Senate.
Congress responded promptly on my
recommendation to clarify and refine the
act, and because the Attorney General
and the Office of Government Ethics have
implemented the law with vigor and
common sense, the foundation has been
laid for a sound program fulfilling my
commitment to assure that Federal offi-
cials are of the highest professional cali-
ber and meet the highest standards of
integrity, openness, and efficiency.
NOTE: As enacted, S. 869 is Public Law 96-
28, approved June 22.
