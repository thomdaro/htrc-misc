tion may be reapportioned among the
other brackets whose quotas have been
filled.
The relief option I have authorized is
slightly less restrictive than the USITC
recommended action though it will be
effective in limiting imports. The USITC
quota was overly restrictive with respect
to lowest price producers and too gener-
ous with higher price clothespins which
are not currently traded in significant vol-
umes. The remedy I have chosen also
would have a less distortive impact on the
imports of additional suppliers, who have
not participated in the surge in imports
and should enable domestic producers to
expand their capacity utilization rates to
more efficient operating levels.

Domestic Clothespin Industry
Memorandum From the President.
February 8, 1979
Memorandum for the Special Repre-
sentative for Trade Negotiations
Subject: Determination Under Section
202(b) of the Trade Act; Clothespins
Pursuant to section 202 (b) (1) of the
Trade Act of 1974 (P.L. 93-618, 88 Stat.
1978), I have determined the action I
will take with respect to the report of the
United States International Trade Com-
mission (USITC), transmitted to me on
December 12, 1978, concerning the re-
sults of its investigation of import injury
which was established on its own motion.
The investigation was initiated as an out-
growth of information collected in con-
junction with Commission investigations
Nos. TA-406-2, TA-406-3, and TA-
406-4, conducted under section 406 (a)
of the Trade Act of 1974 and concerning
clothespins from the People's Republic
of China, the Polish People's Republic,
and the Socialist Republic of Romania.
All four investigations have concerned
clothespins imported under items 790.05,
790.07, and 790.08 of the TSUS.
After considering all relevant aspects
of the case, including those considera-
tions set forth in section 202 (c) of the
Trade Act of 1974, I have decided to ac-
cept a variation of the injury relief rec-
ommendation made by the USITC.
Within 15 days, I will issue a Presidential
Proclamation authorizing that a three-
year global import quota be established
on wood and plastic clothespins (TSUS
item 790.05) with a dutiable value not
over $1.70 per gross in the amount of two
million gross pins. The quota, adminis-
tered quarterly on a pro rata basis, will
be allocated as follows:
Category

900,000
2, 000, 000
not over $1.35 per gross___
Valued over $1.35 per gross but
not over $1.70 per gross---
Total
During the course of each year, as it
becomes apparent that the quota for any
price bracket will not be filled for the
year, then the remainder of the alloca-
tion may be reapportioned among the
brackets whose quotas have been filled.
Relief is warranted for the following
reasons:
1. The social costs of denying relief
would be very high, since producers are
located in isolated regions in the North-
east where alternative employment is
scarce.
