Administration of Jimmy Carter, 1979
simply cannot recognize a joke. Other
people can. We are, therefore, after con-
templation, considering some substantial
changes in the makeup of the White
House senior staff. [Laughter]
Although I prefer not to call any names,
in order to hold down the enthusiasm of
the group, I can say that in the foreseeable
future, the population of Vienna, Georgia,
will grow by about 2 percent. [Laughter]
I understand that Atlantic Monthly has
already made him an offer. [Laughter]
Seriously, I have to admit that Jody
does have some good ideas. For instance,
he has literally been encouraging me to
reopen the indoor White House swimming
pool-[laughter]-suddenly, as a matter
of fact—[laughter]—during one of his
briefings. Any survivors, of course, would
be permitted to have permanent swim-
ming privileges. I would have to person-
ally arrange to put you on the swimming
schedule. [Laughter] Come to think of it,
I probably should not have kicked Jim
Fallows¹ off the tennis court. [Laughter]
A lot of people genuinely just do not
understand the awesome responsibility of
the President of the United States. As you
know, I'm really very busy. But only some
great world crisis could have kept me from
coming here this evening. As a matter of
fact, Dr. Brzezinski almost got fired this
afternoon because he couldn't find one.
[Laughter]
Of course, I also hated to meet [miss] 2
the Los Angeles fundraising banquet last
month. Competent investigative reporting
may some day reveal the real reason that
we presently have a Mideast peace treaty.
After all, I guess if I could go to Jeru-
salem and Cairo to make peace, that I
could come to the Washington Hilton for
the same purpose. [Laughter] But you're
a tougher group than the Knesset. I just

thank God that they don't drink so much.
[Laughter] As a matter of fact, you're
more like my own Knabinet―[laughter]—
I mean, Cabinet.
But I've noticed that alcohol, even a
lot of alcohol, doesn't seem to affect your
judgment very much. You're still able,
under conditions of either sobriety or
otherwise, to concentrate about with the
same facility on the important issues of
the day. [Laughter] You are always try-
ing to root out that genuine insider's back-
ground story. And tonight to show my
good will, I'm going to give you such an
inside story-off the record, of course, so
put away your crayons. [Laughter]
In 1980, as you may have heard, the
most important position of public leader-
ship in America will once again be open,
and we must continue to have strong
leadership. However, image is obviously
just beginning to be a factor. Now, that
John Connally is a master. But on my own,
without using my staff, I have discovered
his secret. I noticed a few months ago
that he parts his hair on the left side.
[Laughter] And I decided, again on my
own-I must take full credit for this-to
eliminate this insidious Republican ad-
vantage by a bold stroke of the comb.
[Laughter] The result has been truly re-
markable. For 2 weeks after I took this
action, neither my wife nor my barber
noticed the change. But the best result
was that Sam Donaldson no longer rec-
ognized me at all. [Laughter]
In spite of this episode, which is inter-
esting, I think you will admit the better
members of the press seldom miss a trick.
You probably already have surmised that
this change from right to left is only for
the primaries—[laughter]—and then for
the general election, right down the mid-
dle. [Laughter]
With responsibilities of statecraft con-
stantly on my shoulders, I really get an-
