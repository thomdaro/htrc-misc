June 13
Administration of Jimmy Carter, 1979
Gold Medal for
Hubert H. Humphrey
Statement on Signing S. 613 Into Law.
June 13, 1979
I have approved S. 613, a bill author-
izing that a special gold medal be struck
in recognition of Hubert Humphrey's
distinguished career, and that as Presi-
dent I present it to Mrs. Humphrey on
behalf of the Congress.
Hubert Humphrey's unyielding dedi-
cation to the principles of equality and
social justice will forever remind us that
one person can make a difference in the
life and well-being of a whole nation. We
have a long road to travel before we fully
achieve the goals he sought, but few men
or women have paved as much of that
road as Hubert Humphrey did. Let us
dedicate ourselves to finishing his work.
It is an honor and privilege for me as
President to join with the Congress in
tribute to this great American.
