(b) airplanes which otherwise would
be bombers of a type equipped for
cruise missiles capable of a range
in excess of 600 kilometers shall
not be considered to be bombers of
a type equipped for cruise missiles
capable of a range in excess of 600
kilometers if they have function-
ally related observable differences
which indicate that they cannot
perform the mission of a bomber
equipped for cruise missiles ca-
pable of a range in excess of 600
kilometers, except that heavy
bombers of current types, as des-
ignated in subparagraph 3(a) of
Article II of the Treaty, which
otherwise would be of a type
equipped for cruise missiles capa-
ble of a range in excess of 600
kilometers shall not be considered
to be heavy bombers of a type
equipped for cruise missiles capa-
ble of a range in excess of 600
kilometers if they are distinguish-
able on the basis of externally
observable differences from heavy
bombers of a type equipped for
cruise missiles capable of a range in
excess of 600 kilometers; and
(c) airplanes which otherwise would
be bombers of a type equipped for
ASBMS shall not be considered to
be bombers of a type equipped for
ASBMs if they have functionally
related observable differences
which indicate that they cannot
perform the mission of a bomber
equipped for ASBMs, except that
heavy bombers of current types,
as designated in subparagraph 3
(a) of Article II of the Treaty,
which otherwise would be of a
type equipped for ASBMS shall
not be considered to be heavy
bombers of a type equipped for
ASBMS if they are distinguishable
on the basis of externally observ-
able differences from heavy bomb-
ers of a type equipped for ASBMs.
First Common Understanding. Function-
ally related observable differences are dif-
ferences in the observable features of air-
planes which indicate whether or not
these airplanes can perform the mission
of a heavy bomber, or whether or not they
can perform the mission of a bomber
equipped for cruise missiles capable of a
range in excess of 600 kilometers or
whether or not they can perform the mis-
sion of a bomber equipped for ASBMs.
Functionally related observable differ-
ences shall be verifiable by national tech-
nical means. To this end, the Parties may
take, as appropriate, cooperative meas-
ures contributing to the effectiveness of
verification by national technical means.
Fifth Agreed Statement. Tupolev-142
airplanes in their current configuration,
that is, in the configuration for anti-sub-
marine warfare, are considered to be air-
planes of a type different from types of
heavy bombers referred to in subpara-
graph 3(a) of Article II of the Treaty
and not subject to the Fourth Agreed
Statement to paragraph 3 of Article II of
the Treaty. This Agreed Statement does
not preclude improvement of Tupolev-
142 airplanes as an anti-submarine system,
for designation in the future of types of
and does not prejudice or set a precedent
airplanes as heavy bombers pursuant to
subparagraph 3(b) of Article II of the
Treaty or for application of the Fourth
Agreed Statement to paragraph 3 of Arti-
cle II of the Treaty to such airplanes.
Second Common Understanding. Not
later than six months after entry into
force of the Treaty the Union of Soviet
Socialist Republics will give its thirty-one
Myasishchev airplanes used as tankers in
1061
