United States-Japan Treaty on
Extradition
Message to the Senate Transmitting the
Treaty. April 4, 1979
To the Senate of the United States:
With a view to receiving the advice and
consent of the Senate to ratification, I
transmit herewith the Treaty of Extradi-
tion Between the United States of Amer-
ica and Japan, together with a related
exchange of notes, signed at Tokyo on
March 3, 1978.
I transmit also, for the information of
the Senate, the report of the Department
of State with respect to the treaty.
The treaty is one of a series of modern
extradition treaties being negotiated by
the United States. It expands the list of
extraditable offenses to include narcotics
offenses, aircraft hijacking, bribery, and
obstruction of justice, as well as many
other offenses not now covered by our
existing extradition treaty with Japan.
Upon entry into force, it will terminate
and supersede the existing Treaty of Ex-
tradition and the Supplementary Conven-
tion of Extradition between the United
States and Japan.
This treaty will make a significant con-
tribution to international cooperation in
law enforcement. I recommend that the
Senate give early and favorable considera-
tion to the treaty and give its advice and
consent to ratification.
The White House,
April 4, 1979.
