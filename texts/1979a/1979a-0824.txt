And many more have lived quietly, de-
fending day by day against the cynical,
the selfish, and the unconcerned, the
principles that we hold dear-often they
have done this in their homes or in their
small communities, often at great cost and
without any praise, without any recogni-
tion, without any glory.
I pray that we will never again have to
defend our freedoms in battle with the
shedding of blood, and that the love of
peace which fills our hearts will at last
prevail. But to survive, our system must

of the United States of America, that no
one is exploited or abused, either by un-
scrupulous employers, unprincipled gang
bosses or smugglers, who prey on poverty,
ignorance, and human misery, and who
sometimes even hold little children as
hostages to wring a few extra dollars from
empty pockets and work-worn hands.
[At this point, the President again spoke in
Spanish. He then translated his remarks as

Justice and respect for each individual's
rights-wherever that individual might
come from-must be practiced every day
by every one of us. It's not enough to be
fair to most of the people most of the time.
We must be fair to all, all of the time. Our
