Economic Opportunity.
From 1971 to 1973, Falco was chief

the Nation launched a concerted effort
against cardiovascular diseases more
than thirty years ago. Since 1948, this
effort has resulted in greatly increased
support for cardiovascular research; for
training thousands of new research work-
ers and clinicians; for health education
and information programs; and for com-
munity service programs concerned with
preventing,
preventing, diagnosing, and relieving
cardiovascular disorders. Over this period,
we have learned more about the cardio-
vascular system and its diseases than dur-
ing all previous medical history. The ap-
plication of this knowledge has enabled us
to decrease the mortality rate for all
cardiovascular diseases combined by 30
percent.
Our successes in combatting cardio-
vascular diseases have accelerated since
1968. I am particularly gratified that the
mortality rate of the two major killers
among this family of diseases-coronary
heart disease and stroke-has decreased
nearly 20 and 25 percent respectively.
If present trends continue during 1979,
there will be at least 170,000 fewer deaths
from cardiovascular disease in the U.S.
than if the mortality rates of ten years
ago still prevailed.
Two organizations have been in the
forefront of the national effort against the
cardiovascular diseases: the National

More than 40 million Americans suffer
from some form of heart or blood vessel
disease. During 1979, these diseases and
their complications will claim more than
980,000 lives and partially or completely
eral agency and the American Heart
Association, supported by private contri-
butions. But it has been a cooperative
effort involving a great many agencies and
groups-Federal and private, national
and local. Our continued success must
rest, as always, on the support and par-
ticipation of the American people.
