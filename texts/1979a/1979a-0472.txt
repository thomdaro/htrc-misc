Administration of Jimmy Carter, 1979
THE PRESIDENT. Perfect. I saw people
who were friendly toward me, who sup-
ported their wonderful leader, President
Sadat, and who demonstrated to the world
that they genuinely want peace and an
end to hatred and war and death and de-
struction; a people who want a better life
in the future and who now have opened
up an opportunity to benefit from a new
relationship not only with Israel but with
other nations in the world.
So, I could not have been more pleased
or favorably impressed than I was in my
visit to Egypt. It was a great visit.
MR. ANDRAWES. Thank you very much,
Mr. President.
THE PRESIDENT. Thank you.
