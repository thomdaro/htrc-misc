Informal Exchanges With Reporters.
April 15, 1979
THE PRESIDENT. Good morning every-
body. Happy Easter.
Q. Thank you. Tell us about your
vacation.
THE PRESIDENT. Well, I'd rather talk
about the vacation than the fishing.
[Laughter] We've had a good vacation
so far.
Q. What about the fishing? Have you
caught anything?
THE PRESIDENT. We caught a few.
Q. Numbers? Size?
THE PRESIDENT. No numbers and sizes.
[Laughter]
Q. Are you going to name a Middle
East negotiator like Scranton to take over
for Atherton?
THE PRESIDENT. Not any time soon.
I think they're ready to start. I hope
you all can hear the singing and all. It's
really good.
REPORTER. Thank you.
[The exchange began at approximately 11 a.m.
as the President was entering the First African
Baptist Church for Easter services. Following
the services, at approximately 1:15 p.m., the
President spoke with reporters as follows.]
Q. Perfect day, isn't it?
THE PRESIDENT. Yes, it is.
Q. The sun is beautiful.
Q. Mr. President, have you been driv-
ing all week? I thought it had been a long
time since you'd driven a car.
THE PRESIDENT. Well, I drive when I
go down to the farm in Plains.
Q. So you don't forget how.
THE PRESIDENT. No, I think they gave
me a sacrificial jeep. So far I haven't
sacrificed it. [Laughter]
Q. Is this your first time driving a jeep?
THE PRESIDENT. Well, when I hunt
quail at home, on my farm, I drive a jeep
some.
Q. Have you seen any alligators or
snakes?
THE PRESIDENT. A couple of alligators.
Q. Any deer?
Q. Did you stop?
THE PRESIDENT. The boat that we used
to fish, when they turned it over yester-
day, it had a big rattlesnake under it.
I've only seen one snake myself. That's
all.
Well, we've seen a lot of deer, and just
saw two turkeys on the way over here to
the church. A lot of wild turkey on this
island, and also a lot of deer, a few
alligators.
Q. Mr. President, anything you'd like
to say to the American people on Easter?
THE PRESIDENT. No. I think you might
quote what I saidâ€”you know, it's just a
wonderful place to be on Easter, you
know, see the sunrise and know what
Christ's life meant and to be with other
Christians.
Q. Are you coming back next year?
THE PRESIDENT. Well, I'd like to.
Somebody suggested I move down here.
[Laughter]
