Administration of Jimmy Carter, 1979
tion 303 of the Clean Air Act, when and
if necessary.
I commend the Governor for his com-
mitment to act with care if he suspends
air pollution regulations under the au-
thority provided by this determination,
since such regulations are important to
protect public health. I commend him for
undertaking energy conservation meas-
ures and for his commitment that no sus-
pension will be granted if the result would
be a violation of any national ambient
primary or secondary air quality standard.
This determination shall be published
in the FEDEral Register.

Egyptian-Israeli Peace Treaty
Letter to the Speaker of the House and the
President of the Senate Transmitting
Proposed Legislation To Implement the
Treaty. April 9, 1979
Dear Mr. Speaker: (Dear Mr. Presi-
dent:)
I hereby transmit a bill "to authorize
supplemental international security assist-
ance for the fiscal year 1979 in support of
the peace treaty between Egypt and Israel
and related agreements, and for other
purposes", and urge its prompt enactment.
The bill authorizes appropriations of
$1,470,000,000 to finance programs total-
ling $4,800,000,000.
The bill authorizes the President (1) to
enter into contracts for the construction of
air bases in Israel, as contemplated by the
Treaty, to replace air bases on the Sinai
peninsula, and (2) to furnish as a grant
to the government of Israel $800,000,000
in defense articles and services for such
construction. In addition, the bill au-
thorizes appropriations of $220,000,000 to
guarantee $2,200,000,000 in loans to
Israel to finance procurement through
fiscal year 1982 of defense articles and
defense services.
For Egypt, the bill authorizes appro-
priations of $150,000,000 to guarantee
$1,500,000,000 in loans to finance pro-
curement through fiscal year 1982 of de-
fense articles and defense services. In ad-
dition, the bill authorizes appropriations
of $300,000,000 in economic assistance to
Egypt.
The supplemental assistance to Egypt
and Israel authorized in the attached bill
will provide tangible evidence of U.S.
dedication to the peace process. It will
clearly demonstrate to the people of these
two countries-more than words alone-
that we will help them reap the advan-
tages of peace. The costs set forth in the
bill are directly related to implementation
of the Peace Treaty. Swift Congressional
action to enact the bill will demonstrate
U.S. capacity to move quickly and deci-
sively to support our friends in the Middle
East.
Unless both Egypt and Israel are con-
fident of their security, enduring peace
can neither be solidified between them
nor broadened to other parties. This legis-
lation will demonstrate that while the
United States continues as an active and
responsive partner in the pursuit of a com-
prehensive Middle East peace we will con-
tinue to be sensitive to the security con-
cerns of Egypt and Israel.
We believe the proposed security assist-
ance legislation should be viewed as an
integrated whole. All elements of the
