Announcement Concerning Executive Order
12132 and Appointment of the Membership

The President has signed an Executive
order creating an emergency board to
investigate the dispute between the Na-
tional Railway Labor Conference and cer-
tain of their employees represented by

ciation.

James J. Reynolds, a former Assistant
Secretary of Labor and Under Secretary
of Labor in the Kennedy and Johnson ad-
ministrations. Reynolds was a member of
the National Labor Relations Board in
the Truman administration, and was
president of the American Institute of
Merchant Shipping from 1969 until his
retirement in 1978. He will serve as Chair-
man of this Emergency Board.
Ida Klaus, of New York City, an arbi-
trator and mediator with more than 40
years' experience in the labor relations
field. She has served as special arbitrator
under the U.S. Steel agreement since
1975. She has also served as solicitor for
the National Labor Relations Board and
labor counsel for New York City. From
1962 to 1975, she was executive director
of the Office of Labor Relations and Col-
lective Bargaining of the New York City
Board of Education.

sel for the House Special Subcommittee
on Education of the Education and Labor
Committee.
This Emergency Board is created under
the procedures of the Railway Labor Act.
It will report its findings and recommen-
dations to the President within 30 days,
and the parties must then consider the
Board's recommendations and try to re-
solve their differences within the next 30-
day period. Without the creation of this
Board, the dispute would threaten a shut-
down on May 10 of 52 of the Nation's
railroads, the number represented by the
National Railway Labor Conference.
