Message to the Congress Transmitting Two
Reports. February 28, 1979
To the Congress of the United States:
In accordance with the provisions of 10
U.S.C. 1124, I am forwarding reports of
the Secretary of Defense and the Secre-
tary of Transportation on awards made
during Fiscal Year 1978 to members of the
Armed Forces for suggestions, inventions
and scientific achievements.
of
The participation of military personnel
in the cash awards program was author-
ized by the Congress in 1965. More than
two million submissions since that time
attest to the program's success in moti-
vating military personnel to find ways
reducing costs and improving efficiency.
Of the suggestions submitted, more than
325,000 have been adopted, with tangible
first-year benefits of more than a billion
dollars.
Of the 98,011 suggestions submitted by
military (including Coast Guard) person-
nel during Fiscal Year 1978, 14,830 were
adopted. Cash awards totalling $1,001,257
were paid for adopted suggestions during
Fiscal Year 1978. These awards were
based not only on the tangible first-year
benefits of $37,263,734 realized from
adopted suggestions during Fiscal Year
1978, but also on many additional benefits
and improvements of an intangible nature.
Enlisted people received $820,006 in
awards during Fiscal Year 1978, repre-
senting 81 percent of the total cash awards
paid during the periods. Officers received
$181,251 during Fiscal Year 1978.
The attached reports of the Secretaries
of Defense and Transportation contain
statistical information on the military
awards program and brief descriptions of
some of the more noteworthy contribu-
tions of military personnel during Fiscal
Year 1978.

North Atlantic Treaty
Organization
Statement on the Appointment of Gen. Ber-
nard W. Rogers as Supreme Allied Com-
mander, Europe, and Commander in Chief of
U.S. Forces in Europe. February 28, 1979
I am pleased today to announce that
the Defense Planning Committee of the
North Atlantic Council has appointed
Gen. Bernard W. Rogers to be the Su-
preme Allied Commander, Europe, suc-
ceeding Gen. Alexander Haig, who has
served with great distinction in that im-
portant post for the past 42 years. In
addition, I am appointing General
Rogers to be Commander in Chief of
United States forces in Europe, a position
also being vacated by General Haig this
June 30. General Rogers is currently serv-
ing as Chief of Staff of the U.S. Army.
The change of military command in
NATO is an appropriate time to reflect
upon the importance of the Alliance to
the United States, to the West as a whole,
and to the cause of world peace.
Thirty years ago, we joined European
and Canadian friends in creating the
North Atlantic Alliance. Since that time,
NATO has been the cornerstone of U.S.
security policy, reflecting the vital impor-
tance of the security and well-being of
Western Europe to the security of North
America. NATO has served us well: It
has helped keep the peace in an area his-
