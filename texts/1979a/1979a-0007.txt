Foreword
Alexis de Tocqueville once wrote that historians and politicians are â€œequally
deceived" by their differing perspectives on public events. Historians, he wrote,
tend to overemphasize the extent to which broad, impersonal forces shape events,
neglecting the sometimes decisive role of specific, day-to-day developments.
Politicians, he remarked, suffer from the opposite handicap. "Living in the
midst of disconnected daily facts, they are prone to imagine that everything is
attributable to particular incidents, and that the wires they pull are the same as
those that move the world."
This collection of Presidential papers, covering the first half of 1979, docu-
ments a number of landmark events the historic Middle East peace treaty, end-
ing thirty years of war between Israel and Egypt; the successful conclusion of the
Multilateral Trade Negotiations; the first overhaul of the Federal civil service in a
century. Together with earlier volumes, it chronicles each major event not as an
isolated moment but as the culmination of a sustained effort.
These papers do something more. They permit the historian to see these break-
throughs as they occurred in the context of the daily business of government.
And they allow public officials like myself to see our actions not as a set of dis-
crete steps, but as part of an historical continuum. In this way, these papers
should enhance the view from both perspectives.
