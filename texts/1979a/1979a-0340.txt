Administration of Jimmy Carter, 1979
per gross provided for under TSUS item
790.05.
5. In accordance with section 203 (d)
(2) of the Trade Act (19 U.S.C. 2253(d)
(2)), I have determined that the level of
import relief hereinafter proclaimed pur-
suant to section 203 (a) (3) of the Trade
Act (19 U.S.C. 2253 (a) (3)), permits the
importation into the United States of a
quantity or value of articles which is not
less than the average annual quantity or
value of such articles imported into the
United States in the 73/78 period, which
I have determined to be the most recent
representative period for imports of such
articles.
NOW, THEREFORE, I, JIMMY CARTER,
President of the United States of Amer-
ica, acting under the authority vested in
me by the Constitution and the statutes of
the United States, including sections 203
and 604 of the Trade Act (19 U.S.C.
2253 and 2483), and in accordance with
Article XIX of the General Agreement
on Tariffs and Trade (GATT) (61 Stat.
(pt. 5) A58; 8 UST (pt. 2) 1786), do
proclaim thatâ€”
(1) Part 1 of Schedule XX to the
GATT is modified to conform with the
actions taken in the Annex to this procla-
mation.
(2) Subpart A, part 2 of the Appendix
to the TSUS is modified as set forth in the
Annex to this proclamation.
(3) This proclamation shall be effec-
tive as to articles entered, or withdrawn
from warehouse, for consumption on or
after February 23, 1979, and before the
close of February 22, 1982, unless the pe-
riod of its effectiveness is earlier expressly
modified or terminated.
IN WITNESS WHEREOF, I have here-
unto set my hand this twenty-third day
of February, in the year of our Lord nine-
teen hundred and seventy-nine, and of
the Independence of the United States
of America the two hundred-third.

Initial Fuel Assurances
Message to the Congress Transmitting a
Report. February 23, 1979
To the Congress of the United States:
Pursuant to Section 104(b) of the
Nuclear Nonproliferation Act of 1978,
enclosed is a report on Preliminary Pro-
posals on Initial Fuel Assurances.
As indicated in the report, we are con-
tinuing our assessment of alternative
fuel assurances schemes and will inform
of
you any proposals as these assessments
are concluded. The current alternatives
envision uranium stockpiles with size
ranges between 2 million and 10 million
separative work units. Present estimates
of the cost for these program alterna-
tives, based on the current market value
of the uranium fuel and the enrichment
services, are approximately a half billion
to more than 2 billion dollars.
The White House,
