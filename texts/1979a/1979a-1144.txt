Administration of Jimmy Carter, 1979
local and State officials who are enforcing
the law and controlling any violence on
or near the Nation's highways.
The full resources of the Department
of Justice will be used to ensure that
order is preserved, that violators are ap-
prehended, and that individual rights of
American citizens are protected. As neces-
sary, the Federal Government will also
coordinate the protection of truckdrivers
who are moving in interstate commerce.
We will do whatever is necessary to see
that those truckers who want to work are
not threatened by either violence or in-
timidation.
I want to commend the Governors
who have acted swiftly and effectively to
stop violence in their States. They have
my full support and the support of the
Federal Government for their efforts to
put an immediate end to strike-related
violence and lawlessness.
Director Webster is here with me, and
he will be glad to answer any questions
that you might have about how the Fed-
eral Government is and will cooperate
with local and State officials in eliminat-
ing violence in this strike, and he's here
now for that purpose.
NOTE: The President spoke at 4:03 p.m. in
the Briefing Room at the White House.
