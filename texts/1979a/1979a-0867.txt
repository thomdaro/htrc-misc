Administration of Jimmy Carter, 1979
May 14
121 graduating high school seniors,
chosen on the basis of academic excel-
lence, leadership, and accomplishment in
other areas such as the visual and per-
forming arts. The scholars will visit
Washington from June 17 to 20 as the
guests of the White House and the U.S.
Office of Education.
The Presidential Scholars program,
established by Executive order in 1964,
annually honors one boy and one girl
from each State, the District of Columbia,
Puerto Rico, Americans living abroad,
and 15 students selected at large. The
students, from both public and private
schools, are initially identified through
scores on precollege examinations na-
tionally administered in secondary
schools. The scholars are selected by the
Commission on Presidential Scholars, a
panel of private citizens from a variety
of fields, who serve without compensa-
tion.
During their visit to Washington, the
scholars will receive Presidential Scholars
medallions in a White House ceremony.
They will also attend seminars with
authorities in many fields, meet with their
elected officials, and visit historic sites.
The scholars receive no financial award.
