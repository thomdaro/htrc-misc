Administration of Jimmy Carter, 1979
Jan. 15
responsible budget, and a very enlight-
ened budget.
As I said earlier, in allocation of funds
for civil rights, we will have substantial
increases; for minority businesses, sub-
stantial increases; for allocations of funds
for the poor, substantial increases in 1980,
about the same as we had between '78
and '79. And I believe that if the Congress
does make any changes, they will be rela-
tively minor.
We'll be monitoring this very closely, be-
cause I would not stand idly by and see the
Congress take funds away from those
who need Federal assistance most and give
it to those less worthy. So, we'll be moni-
toring it closely. But I think it's a good,
sound budget and, in general, the Con-
gress will approve.
MR. AGURS. Thank you, Mr. President.
THE PRESIDENT. Thank you.
I have en-
joyed it very much, Don. I thank all of
you for letting me be with you.
