United Food and Commercial
Workers International Union
Remarks at the Union's Founding Convention.
June 7, 1979
President Bill Wynn, United Food and
Commercial Workers:
I want to thank you for that introduc-
tion and also that reception. I've always
known that Bill Wynn was a man of great
vision, but I never knew before that he
was such an accurate analyst of recent
history, and I thank you very much.
[Laughter]
I'm honored in several ways to be in-
troduced by one of the most decent, effec-
tive, and respected labor leaders in Amer-
ica, your president and my friend, Bill
Wynn; to be able to join your secretary-
treasurer, Sam Talarico, the members of
the executive board, and the first dele-
gates to the newest and now the largest
union in the AFL-CIO, the United Food
and Commercial Workers Union.
I'm honored to be with one of the most
committed and the most caring men
who've ever served on a President's Cabi-
net, Ray Marshall; and to be with the
president emeritus of the Amalgamated
Meatcutters, one of the fine leaders of the
American labor movement, a man that I
revere and respect, Paddy Gorman; and
with a friend of yours and mineâ€”who,
coincidentally, joined me and my wife
last night for supper at the White House
with his wife-a great labor leader in
America, Lane Kirkland.
I understand this is your inaugural
convention. When I heard you were hav-
ing an inauguration, I came right over.
[Laughter] I had to walk all the way. As
a matter of fact, I walk a lot these days.
They've taken my parking place away,
too. [Laughter]
I just left Fritz Mondale, who's meet-
ing with the six New England Governors
about the energy question. As I left, Fritz
said, "Did you hear that Bill Wynn has
endorsed you for reelection?" And I said,
"Yes. And did you also hear that Bill
Wynn has appointed 50 vice presidents in
this new union?" And Fritz said, "Well,
nobody's perfect, Mr. President."
[Laughter]
I'm going to make kind of a different
speech to you this afternoon, relatively
brief, from my heart, as President of our
great country. This historic merger of
two unions, each with such a proud his-
tory, is a notable achievement not just
for the labor movement itself but for our
country. When this great new organiza-
tion of working people speaks out for so-
