Administration of Jimmy Carter, 1979
May 7
Prompt Congressional approval of the
Standby Gasoline Rationing Plan is es-
sential. Failure of the Congress to act will
leave the Nation vulnerable to economic
disruption and long gasoline station lines.
It is obviously impossible to develop a
plan which will be perceived to be fair by
each person. The proposed
The proposed plan, as
amended, is designed to be broadly equit-
able, practical and administrable. If we
fail to approve a standby rationing sys-
tem, the Nation's resolve to deal with a se-
rious supply interruption will be called
into question. The resulting damage to
the economy and personal hardships to
our citizens could be substantial.
I urge the prompt and favorable con-
sideration by the Congress of the Standby
Gasoline Rationing Plan and this amend-
ment.
