Administration of Jimmy Carter, 1979
June 6
there is no step that EPA or any Federal
agency can take to accomplish that. But
today's action is significant, for it repre-
sents the first major step taken by the Fed-
eral Government which will help preserve
Ohio mining jobs.
It may be possible in the future to ex-
pand on today's action. Within the admin-
istration, we will continue our efforts in
that direction. With the cooperation of
State and local officials, those in the coal
mining industry, and the Ohio utilities, I
am hopeful that we can succeed.
