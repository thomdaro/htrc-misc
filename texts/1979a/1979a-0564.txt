day are educated in the theory and prac-
tice of geriatrics. They are better able to
meet the medical, social and emotional
needs of their patients. By their resource-
fulness and dedication these individuals
are helping to relieve the burdens of
families across this land.
I therefore welcome this opportunity
to pay tribute to the unselfish individuals
who provide service for those in nursing
homes. New research and technology have
helped to improve the quality and lon-
gevity of life; and thanks to these devoted
professionals, America's nursing homes
are meeting the challenge of maintaining
the highest standards of patient care. I
ask all Americans to join in the spirit of
this observance.
