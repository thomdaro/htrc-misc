receivers, also provided for in item 685.20
of the TSUS.
2. On June 24, 1977, in order to remedy
the serious injury found to exist by the
USITC, I proclaimed (Presidential Proc-
lamation 4511) that the Government of
the United States of America and the
Government of Japan had entered into an
orderly marketing agreement on May 20,
1977, pursuant to section 203 (a) (4) of
the Trade Act (19 U.S.C. 2253(a) (4))
limiting the export from Japan to the
United States of color television receivers
and certain subassemblies thereof, for a
period of three years beginning July 1,
1977, to 1.75 million units in each annual
restraint period.
3. In Proclamation 4511 I delegated
my authority under section 203 (e) (3) of
the Trade Act (19 U.S.C. 2253 (e) (3))
to determine that any agreement nego-
tiated pursuant to section 203 (a) (4) of
the Trade Act (19 U.S.C. 2253 (a) (4))
is no longer effective to the Special Rep-
resentative for Trade Negotiations (here-
inafter referred to as the "Special Rep-
resentative").
4. Pursuant to the authority delegated
to the Special Representative in para-
graphs 2 and 4 of Proclamation 4511, and
after consultation with representatives of
member agencies of the Trade Policy
Staff Committee, the Special Represent-
ative has determined that imports of
color television receivers and certain sub-
assemblies thereof from Taiwan and the
Republic of Korea have increased in such
quantities so as to disrupt the effective-
ness of the orderly marketing agreement
with Japan with respect to such products
and that for the purposes of section 203
(e) (3) of the Trade Act (19 U.S.C.
2253 (e) (3)) the
the orderly marketing
agreement with Japan does not continue
to be effective. I concur with that de-
termination.
5. Pursuant to the authority vested in
the President by the Constitution and the
statutes of the United States, including
section 203 (a) (5) and 203 (e) (3) of the
Trade Act (19 U.S.C. 2253 (a) (5) and
2253 (e) (3)), and in order to restore the
effectiveness of the orderly marketing
agreement with Japan, and to remedy
the serious injury to the domestic industry
producing color television receivers and
certain subassemblies thereof found to
exist by the USITC, orderly marketing
agreements were concluded on Decem-
ber 14, 1978, and December 29, 1978, be-
tween the Government of the United
States of America and the Government
of the Republic of Korea and Taiwan.
respectively.
The orderly marketing agreements
limit the export from the Republic of
Korea and Taiwan to the United States
of color television receivers and certain
subassemblies thereof, for the period
February 1, 1979, through June 30, 1980,
and set forth conditions under which
limitations will be placed on the impor-
tation into the United States of such
articles by the Government of the United
States through quantitative restrictions.
These restrictions are to be implemented
under the authority of sections 203 (a)
(5), (e) (3), and (g) (2) of the Trade
Act (19 U.S.C. 2253 (a) (5), (e) (3), and
(g) (2)).
6. In accordance with section 203 (d)
(2) of the Trade Act (19 U.S.C. 2253
(d) (2)), I have determined that the level
of import relief hereinafter proclaimed
permits the importation into the United
States of a quantity or value of articles
which is not less than the average annual
quantity or value of such articles imported
