Adolph Dubs
Statement on the Death of the U.S.
Ambassador to Afghanistan.
February 14, 1979
I am shocked and saddened by the mur-
der of Ambassador Adolph Dubs in Kabul
this morning. The act of brutality which
took his life has deprived our Nation of
one of its most able public servants.
Throughout his distinguished career in
the Foreign Service, Ambassador Dubs
took on difficult and challenging jobs, per-
forming them with exemplary dedication
and skill. He died as he lived in the serv-
ice of his countryâ€”and the manner of his
death redoubles our dedication to the
struggle against the kind of senseless
violence which took his life. My thoughts
and prayers are with the family of Am-
bassador Dubs.
NOTE: Ambassador Dubs was kidnaped in
Kabul by terrorists on the morning of February
14, and was subsequently killed during an at-
tempt by Afghan police to free him from his
captors.
