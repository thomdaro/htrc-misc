Administration of Jimmy Carter, 1979
Jan. 22
improve its own means of establishing pri-
orities. I have worked closely with the
Congress, and will continue in this spirit
of cooperation.
I look forward to working with the
Congress and its leadership on this budget.
The decisions I have made are difficult
ones. They involve, not figures on a bal-
ance sheet, but the lives and future of the
American people. I have chosen restraint
in Government spending because inflation
must be controlled. I have tried to be
equitable in ordering priorities. Yet I
have continued to support those programs
that represent our most pressing needs. To
do so I have terminated, reduced, or de-
ferred other programs.
It is difficult to maintain a sense of
strong national purpose when we do not
face a clear and immediate crisis. But it is
equally important. These are times when
responsible leadership means anticipating
those day-to-day actions that enable us to
avoid crises and to build toward the fu-
ture. This has been the fundamental pur-
pose behind the decisions considered here,
and that is the intent of this budget.
