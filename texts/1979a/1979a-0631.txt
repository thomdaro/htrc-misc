Administration of Jimmy Carter, 1979
Apr. 6
Three Mile Island
Nuclear Facility
White House Statement. April 6, 1979
The President is concerned about re-
ports that some members of the public
fear the purity of food from the area sur-
rounding the Three Mile Island nuclear
plant.
These fears are not grounded in fact.
Current readings show nothing to fear
from food grown, harvested, or produced
in that area. Both the Food and Drug
Administration and the Food Safety and
Quality Service of the USDA, on the Fed-
eral side, and State health officials are
making exhaustive tests on foodstuffs in
that area. They have found absolutely no
danger to exist.
Tests of fish taken from the Susque-
hanna River downstream from the nu-
clear plant, of fish from a hatchery, of
food in processing plants, of meat and
poultry in packing houses, and of solid
food taken from grocery store shelves in
the immediate area have all been nega-
tive. No radioactivity above the ever-pres-
ent background levels has been found in
these foods-even within 3 miles of the
nuclear plant.
USDA officials briefly closed six small
packing plants near Three Mile Island on
Friday until they had the results of their
tests. That was out of an abundance of
caution. When the tests came in negative,
the plants were reopened on Monday.
Measurements of milk found-as has
been fully reported-a barely discernible
level of radiation that is only one quar-
ter of 1 percent of what could be con-
sidered a potential health hazard. That
tiny measurement in milk alone was much
lower than the level of radioactivity found
elsewhere in the United States following a
Chinese nuclear test. And that milk was
safe to drink.
As far as it is humanly possible to de-
termine, the food from the Three Mile
Island area is as safe to produce, buy,
transport, prepare, and eat as the food
available at any other place in the United
States.
