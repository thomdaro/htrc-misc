Administration of Jimmy Carter, 1979
lic with Respect to Taxes on Income and
Property of July 28, 1967, as amended by
the Protocol of October 12, 1970. The
Protocol, together with a related ex-
change of notes, was signed at Washing-
ton on November 24, 1978. For the
information of the Senate, I also transmit
the related exchange of notes and the re-
port of the Department of State with
respect to the Protocol.
The Protocol breaks new ground by
providing for the first time that the coun-
try of residence (France) and the country
of citizenship (United States) share the
responsibility to avoid double taxation of
expatriate U.S. citizens.
Early ratification of the Protocol is es-
sential as a new French law which takes
effect on January 1, 1979, may otherwise
subject U.S. citizens living in France to
double taxation. The Protocol provides
for retroactive effect, upon entry into
force, to January 1, 1979.
The accompanying exchange of notes
clarifies the treatment by France of cer-
tain income and expenses of U.S. citizens
resident in France. It also points out cer-
tain issues of continuing concern for which
no current solution could be found.
I recommend that the Senate give early
and favorable consideration to this Pro-
tocol and advise and consent to its
ratification.

February 9, 1979.
