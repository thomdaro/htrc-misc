Administration of Jimmy Carter, 1979
Mar. 6
The President's Trip to Egypt
and Israel
Announcement of the Trip. March 5, 1979
President Carter has accepted invita-
tions from Prime Minister Begin and Pres-
ident Sadat and will depart Washington
on Wednesday afternoon for Egypt and
Israel.
The President will arrive in Egypt on
Thursday afternoon for talks with Presi-
dent Sadat. He will then fly to Israel on
Saturday evening for talks with Prime
Minister Begin.
The talks will focus on the peace proc-
ess, regional security, and bilateral issues.
As he stated last Tuesday, the Presi-
dent believes that we must not allow the
prospects for peace which seemed so
bright last September to continue to dim
and perhaps to vanish. If we do, the judg-
ment of history and of our children will
rightly condemn us.

Hospital Cost Containment
Remarks Announcing Proposed Legislation.
March 6, 1979
THE PRESIDENT. Today I am submitting
to the Congress one of the most critical
anti-inflation legislative proposals that the
Congress will ever consider, the Hospital
Cost Containment Act of 1979.
Inflation remains our most serious do-
mestic problem. It affects every person
and every institution in this country. In-
flation threatens the health not only of our
domestic economy but of the basic struc-
ture of our own society.
The American people want me, and
they want the other elected representa-
