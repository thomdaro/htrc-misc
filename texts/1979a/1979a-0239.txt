Toasts at the State Dinner. February 6, 1979
THE PRESIDENT. Prime Minister Kriang-
sak, Mrs. Virat, all the distinguished
guests from Thailand, and our friends
from throughout our country:
First of all, let me say that it's a great
honor for me to welcome all of you guests
to the White House and, particularly, our
honored guest, who comes here represent-
ing a great nation and a great people.
This is the first time since 1968 that
we've had a Prime Minister from Thai-
land come as an honored and official
guest to visit the White House. And I
think it was in 1967 that King Phumi-
"(a) Those under Section 502B of the phol came here with Her Majesty, the
Act.".

JIMMY CARTER
The White House,
February 6, 1979.
[Filed with the Office of the Federal Register,
11:51 a.m., February 7, 1979]
Queen, to visit the President.
So, this is indeed a rare pleasure and
a long overdue visit, Mr. Prime Minister,
on your part, to the White House, to pay
homage to the friendship that has ex-
isted between our two countries for more
than 150 years.
As I mentioned today in my welcoming
remarks, the first nation in Asia with
whom the United States signed a treaty
of peace was with the people of Thailand,
then known as Siam, in 1833, February
1833, 145-146 years ago. And we are
very deeply grateful for the tremendous
benefits that have accrued to our country
from this long relationship between our
people.
Thailand has been a country with very
sound judgment, wisdom among the lead-
ers-not always perfect, but close to it.
In 1861, for instance, King Rama was
not very well advised. He offered to give
a fleet of elephants to then President
Lincoln to help expedite the end of the
War Between the States. [Laughter] For-
tunately for the South, President Lincoln
did not accept the gift [laughter]—
