JOINT STATEMENT OF PRINCIPLES AND
BASIC GUIDELINES FOR SUBSEQUENT
NEGOTIATIONS ON THE LIMITATION OF
STRATEGIC ARMS
The United States of America and the
Union of Soviet Socialist Republics,
hereinafter referred to as the Parties,
Having concluded the Treaty on the
Limitation of Strategic Offensive Arms,
Reaffirming that the strengthening of
strategic stability meets the interests of
the Parties and the interests of interna-
tional security,
Convinced that early agreement on the
further limitation and further reduction
of strategic arms would serve to strength-
en international peace and security and
to reduce the risk of outbreak of nuclear
war,
Have agreed as follows:
First. The Parties will continue to pur-
sue negotiations, in accordance with the
principle of equality and equal security,
on measures for the further limitation
and reduction in the numbers of strategic
arms, as well as for their further qualita-
tive limitation.
In furtherance of existing agreements
between the Parties on the limitation and
reduction of strategic arms, the Parties
will continue, for the purposes of reduc-
ing and averting the risk of outbreak of
nuclear war, to seek measures to strength-
en strategic stability by, among other
things, limitations on strategic offensive
arms most destabilizing to the strategic
balance and by measures to reduce and to
avert the risk of surprise attack.
Second. Further limitations and reduc-
tions of strategic arms must be subject to
adequate verification by national tech-
nical means, using additionally, as appro-
priate, cooperative measures contributing
to the effectiveness of verification by na-
tional technical means. The Parties will
seek to strengthen verification and to per-
fect the operation of the Standing Con-
sultative Commission in order to promote
assurance of compliance with the obliga-
tions assumed by the Parties.
Third. The Parties shall pursue in the
course of these negotiations, taking into
consideration factors that determine the
strategic situation, the following objec-
tives:
1) significant and substantial reduc-
tions in the numbers of strategic of
fensive arms;
2) qualitative limitations on strategic
offensive arms, including restric-
tions on the development, testing,
and deployment of new types of
strategic offensive arms and on the
modernization of existing strategic
offensive arms;
3) resolution of the issues included in
the Protocol to the Treaty Between
the United States of America and
the Union of Soviet Socialist Re-
1078
