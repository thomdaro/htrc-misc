THE PRESIDENT'S
NEWS CONFERENCE OF
JANUARY 26, 1979
THE PRESIDENT. Good afternoon.
Ms. Thomas [Helen Thomas, United
Press International].
PEOPLE'S REPUBLIC OF CHINA
AND TAIWAN
Q. Mr. President, the United States
has acknowledged that there is one
China, and Taiwan is a part of it. And,
remembering the Gulf of Tonkin reso-
lution as an underpinning of the Viet-
nam war, my question is, are you con-
cerned that the congressional resolutions
regarding Taiwan's security may in-
fringe on China's sovereignty and, two,
may involve us at some future point in
Asia again?
THE PRESIDENT. No, I'm not con-
cerned about that. I could not approve
any legislation presented to me by Con-
gress that would be contradictory or that
which would violate the agreements that
we have concluded with the Republic
of China-the People's Republic of
China. I, myself, am committed to a
strong and a prosperous and a free peo-
ple on Taiwan. We intend to carry on
our diplomatic relations with the Peo-
ple's Republic of China as the Govern-
ment of China, but we'll have trade re-
lationships, cultural relationships with
the people on Taiwan. And I believe
that the legislation that has now been
presented to the Congress is a good
foundation for this.
But I don't see this as an opening for
bloodshed or war. I think the statements
made by the Chinese leaders since the
announcement of intentions to establish
diplomatic relations have been very con-
structive and have indicated a peaceful
intent.
Q. Are you speaking also of the Ken-
nedy resolution, which will be intro-
duced on Monday, or only your own
resolution?
THE PRESIDENT. I haven't read the so-
called Kennedy resolution. I really don't
believe that any resolution is needed. I
think our legislative proposal and the
announcement made about normali-
zation, the combination of those two
is adequate.
STRATEGIC ARMS LIMITATION
Q. Mr. President, on Tuesday you said
that we would have a SALT agreement
if the Soviet Union continued to nego-
tiate in good faith.
THE PRESIDENT. Yes.
Q. Do you have any slight doubt in
your mind on that score?
THE PRESIDENT. No. I've been in
office now 2 years, and we've been nego-
tiating with the Soviets almost full-time
on a SALT agreement. Prior to that
