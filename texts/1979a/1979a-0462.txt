Joel W. Solomon
To Jay Solomon
I accept your resignation with regret
and with gratitude for the services you
have rendered to this Administration and
to the American taxpaper.
Because of your leadership and in-
tegrity, decades of waste and corruption
at the GSA are now being exposed, and
those who have betrayed the public trust
are being identified and punished. That
process will be continued and expanded.
Your willingness to be available to as-
sist your successor after March 31st will
help me to insure that the investigations,
reorganization and administrative im-
provements you began will be pursued
aggressively.
You take with you my warmest per-
sonal affection and best wishes.
Sincerely,
JIMMY CARTER
[The Honorable Joel W. Solomon, Adminis-
trator, General Services Administration, Wash-
ington, D.C. 20405]
