Administration of Jimmy Carter, 1979
pursuant to the Pelly Amendment to the
Fishermen's Protective Act of 1967, that
nationals of Peru, Chile and the Republic
of Korea were conducting whaling opera-
tions in a manner that diminishes the ef-
fectiveness of the International Whaling
Commission conservation programs.
Under the Pelly Amendment, such a
certification must be followed by a report
to the Congress. I am pleased to transmit
the attached report which indicates that
all three of these nations are becoming
members of the International Whaling
Commission and will therefore voluntari-
ly become subject to its conservation pro-
grams. Thus, I am not at this time im-
posing sanctions against these nations.

REPORT TO CONGRESS
The Pelly Amendment to the Fisher-
men's Protective Act of 1967, 22 U.S.C.
ยง 1978 (1971), as amended, provides that
when the Secretary of Commerce deter-
mines that nationals of a foreign country,
directly or indirectly, are conducting fish-
ing operations in a manner or under cir-
cumstances which diminish the effective-
ness of an international fishery conserva-
tion program, the Secretary shall certify
such determination to the President.
Upon receipt of such certification, the
President may direct the Secretary of the
Treasury to prohibit the importation into
the United States of fishery products of
the offending country for such duration
as the President determines appropriate to
the extent that such prohibition is sanc-
tioned by the General Agreement on Tar-
iffs and Trade. Within sixty days follow-
ing any such certification, the President
is required to notify the Congress of any
action taken pursuant to such certifica-
tion.
On December 14, 1978, Secretary of
Commerce Kreps certified to me, pur-
suant to the Pelly Amendment, that na-
tionals of Peru, Chile and the Republic
of Korea were conducting whaling opera-
tions in a manner and under circum-
stances that diminish the effectiveness
of International Whaling Commission
(IWC) conservation programs.
Peruvian vessels caught 592 Bryde's
and sei whales in the waters off the west-
ern coast of South America during the
1975-1976 season, all of which were in
excess of the IWC conservation quota of
198. Peruvian vessels also caught 1,261
sperm whales during the 1975-1976 sea-
son, which exceeded the IWC conserva-
tion quota for such whales by 396. During
the 1976-1977 season, Peruvian vessels
caught 1,140 sperm whales, despite the
IWC prohibition of such catches. Peru-
vian vessels also caught 368 Bryde's and
sei whales during the 1976-1977 season,
despite the IWC prohibition of Bryde's
whale catches and despite the catch by
other countries of 298 of the 388 sei
whales permitted by the IWC. Although
precise information by species taken
is not available for the 1977-1978 sea-
son, the Government of Peru estab-
lished a unilateral quota of 300 sei
and Bryde's whales and 900 sperm whales
for that season, despite the IWC prohibi-
tion of Bryde's and sperm whale catches.
Peruvian vessels continued to hunt in the
waters off Peru and Chile during the
1977-1978 season, and at least 1,085
Bryde's and sperm whales were taken by
Peruvian vessels during that season, de-
spite the IWC prohibition of such catches.
Although precise information is not
available for the 1975-1976 season, Chil-
ean vessels caught at least 23 sei whales
in the waters off the west coast of South
America during that season, all of which
were in excess of the IWC conservation
quota of 198. During the 1976-1977 sea-
