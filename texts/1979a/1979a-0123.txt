decent home, and protection against dis-
ease.
It can help us build a nation and a
world where all people are free to seek
the truth and to add to human under-
standing, so that all of us may live our

Tonight, I ask you, the Members of
the Congress, to join me in building that
new foundation-a better foundationâ€”
for our beloved country and our world.
Thank you very much.

Chinese New Year, 1979
Message of the President. January 24, 1979
New Year's Eve in the Chinese tradi-
tion is a time of reunion and reconcilia-
tion. It is a time when family quarrels are
forgotten and when doors and windows
are left open to give access to any benef-
icent spirits that may be passing.
This tradition takes on a special sig-
nificance this year as the American and
Chinese people build new ties of friend-
ship and mutual cooperation.
Let Americans of Chinese ancestry and,
indeed, all our citizens join in a special
New Year's prayer that this relationship
will blossom for the benefit of all Chinese
and American people and of all nations.
Rosalynn and I welcome this opportu-
nity to express our warmest New Year
wishes to all Chinese Americans. May
this Year of the Ram be remembered for
having strengthened the structure of
peace and fulfilled the hopes of all man-
kind for a more tranquil, prosperous and
satisfying life.
