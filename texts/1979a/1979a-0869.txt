Alaska Public Lands Legislation.
Letter to the Members of the House of
Representatives. May 14, 1979
You and your colleagues in the House of
Representatives will soon cast the most
important conservation vote of this cen-
tury. Your vote on the Alaska lands bill is
an opportunity to determine the protec-
tion and use of millions of acres of Federal
land and resources in America's last
frontier.
The Udall-Anderson substitute bill is
balanced. It will allow development of
nearly all of Alaska's oil and gas resources
and most of its other minerals as well. It
tial to Alaska's native cultures, scenic
wonders and abundant wildlife.
The other bills before the Congress are
unacceptable. In these bills, the Arctic
National Wildlife Range-the calving
grounds and migratory route for the last
great caribou herd-would be threatened
by oil and gas exploration activities. Two
of the most significant Alaska National
Monuments-Admiralty Island and Misty
Fiords would be chopped in half. There
are many other objectionable features of
these bills which Administration officials
have enumerated.
After the 95th Congress adjourned I
took a number of steps to protect Alaska
lands, including the establishment of 17
National Monuments covering 56 million
acres. Legislative action offers Congress
the opportunity not only to designate the
Federal lands in Alaska but also to provide
for tailor-made management schemes
which in some cases are more lenient than
the current situation. However, should
legislation not strike an appropriate bal-
ance in Alaska, I will not hesitate to con-
tinue administrative protections.
This is an issue where the pressures of
the moment must not be allowed to out-
weigh our responsibilities to future gener-
ations. I urge you to support the Udall-
Anderson bill.
Sincerely,
JIMMY CARTER
