Administration of Jimmy Carter, 1979
of the House of Representatives to vote
for any plan because it's politically
difficult.
I challenge the Congress within this
next 90 days to develop their own ration-
ing plan-fair, equitable, and balanced.

sible assistance if and when they are will-
ing to exhibit the willingness to take this
necessary action in the interest of our
country.
Thank you very much.
