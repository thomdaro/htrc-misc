Administration of Jimmy Carter, 1979
⚫ the Federal government was operat-
ing inefficiently in numerous vital areas;
• trust in the openness and integrity of
the government was low;
major social problems were being
ignored or inadequately addressed by the
Federal government.
In the ensuing two years, we have
tackled these problems head-on. While
problems cannot be solved overnight, real
progress has been made:
• the economy has strengthened-real
Gross National Product has increased
Product has increased
10% and real disposable personal income
has increased 8.9%;
⚫ the unemployment rate has de-
creased by 25% since my election, from
nearly 8% to 5.9%; 7.3 million new jobs
have been created; total employment has
reached a record of 95.9 million;
• a comprehensive national energy
policy has been enacted and a Depart-
ment of Energy created to help imple-
ment it;
• the first major reform of Civil Serv-
ice System in nearly a century was en-
acted; 6 reorganization plans have been
approved and implemented; the Federal
paperwork burden has been reduced by
10%; inspectors general are being placed
in departments and agencies to help root
out fraud and abuse; zero-based budget-
ing practices have been instituted
throughout the government; several
hundred million dollars have been saved
through sound cash management re-
forms; regulations are being written in
simple English, and a Regulatory Coun-
cil has been established to develop the
Nation's first regulatory calendar and
agenda;
• a renewed sense of confidence and
faith in the government is gradually be-
ing restored;
• long-ignored domestic problems
have been attacked aggressively: the Na-
tion's first urban policy was developed
and its implementation begun; the Social
Security System was refinanced to assure
its long run solvency; the Humphrey-
Hawkins Full Employment Act was
passed; aid to education has been ex-
panded by 50%; and a welfare reform
program was developed and debated in
Congress and will serve as a foundation
for our efforts this year to overhaul the
welfare system;
• cumbersome regulatory apparatus
which deters competition in our economy
was dismantled by the deregulation of the
airline industry.
DOMESTIC POLICY PRIORITIES
Over the next year, our domestic pro-
gram will concentrate on further develop-
ing a new foundation for progress in each
of several areas:
ing to pursue our employment and other
• restraining inflation, while continu-
economic and budgetary goals;
making government more efficient
and effective;
• enhancing basic human and social
needs;
protecting and enhancing our rights
and liberties; and
• preserving and developing our nat-
ural resources.
INFLATION
My Administration's major domestic
priority is to reduce the rate of inflation,
while maintaining economic growth. That
is clearly the major domestic concern of
the American people, and it is the prob-

Inflation places a cruel burden on the

and job creation. This is more than an
