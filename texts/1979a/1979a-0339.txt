come your advice; we look forward to
your support.

Clothespin Imports
Proclamation 4640. February 23, 1979
TEMPORARY QUANTITATIVE LIMITATION
ON THE IMPORTATION INTO THE
UNITED STATES OF CERTAIN CLOTHES-
PINS
By the President of the United States
A Proclamation
1. Pursuant to section 201(d) (1) of the
Trade Act of 1974 (the Trade Act)
(19 U.S.C. 2251(d) (1)), the United
States International Trade Commission
(USITC) on December 12, 1978, re-
ported to the President (USITC Report
201-36) the results of its investigation
under section 201(b) of the Trade Act
(19 U.S.C. 2251(b)). The USITC de-
termined that clothespins provided for in
items 790.05, 790.07, and 790.08 of the
Tariff Schedules of the United States
(TSUS) (19 U.S.C. 1202) are being im-
ported into the United States in such in-
creased quantities as to be a substantial
cause of serious injury to the domestic
industry producing articles like or directly
competitive with the imported articles. In
order to remedy the serious injury to the
domestic industry that it has found to ex-
ist, the USITC recommended the impo-
sition of a 5-year quota on U.S. imports
of wood and plastic spring-type clothes-
pins with a dutiable value not over $2.10
per gross provided for under TSUS item
790.05.
2. On February 8, 1979, pursuant to
section 202(b)(1) of the Trade Act (19
U.S.C. 2252(b)(1)), and after taking
into account the considerations specified
in section 202(c) of the Trade Act (19
U.S.C. 2252(c)), I determined to rem-
edy the injury found to exist by the
USITC through the proclamation of a
3-year quota on U.S. imports of wood and
plastic spring-type clothespins with a duti-
able value not over $1.70 per gross pro-
vided for under TSUS item 790.05. On
February 8, 1979, in accordance with
section 203(b)(1) of the Trade Act (19
U.S.C. 2253(b)(1)), I transmitted a re-
port to the Congress setting forth my de-
termination and intention to proclaim a
quota and stating the reasons why my de-
cision differed from the action recom-
mended by the USITC.
3. Section 203 (e) (1) of the Trade Act
(19 U.S.C. 2253 (e) (1)) requires that
import relief be proclaimed and take ef-
fect within 15 days after the import relief
determination date.
4. Pursuant to sections 203 (a) (3) and
203 (e) (1) of the Trade Act (19 U.S.C.
2253(a) (3) and 2253 (e) (1)), I am pro-
viding import relief through the tempo-
rary imposition of a quota on U.S. imports
of wood and plastic spring-type clothes-
pins with a dutiable value not over $1.70
