Administration of Jimmy Carter, 1979
budgeting, and regulatory reform, sunset
will help make the Government more effi-
cient, more economical, and more respon-
sive. That is why I have long supported
the sunset approach.
In addition, H.R. 2 provides for sunset
reviews for tax expenditures, and I sup-
port that provision. Tax expenditures total
over $150 billion. These programs involve
spending money for social goals, and they
need regular reviews just as much as direct
spending programs.
Sunset is a vital tool for controlling the
Federal deficit. I congratulate Representa-
tives Blanchard, Gephardt, and Mineta
for sponsoring H.R. 2, and I congratulate
Chairmen Bolling and Long and Con-
gressman Derrick for the careful study
they are giving to this bill and related
proposals. I urge the Congress to move
forward this year.
