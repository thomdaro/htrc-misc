Administration of Jimmy Carter, 1979
I am pleased to report that substantial
progress has been made since the June
1978 IWC meeting.
The Government of the Republic of
Korea became a member of the IWC on
December 29, 1978, and the whaling ac-
tivities of its nationals are now subject to
IWC conservation measures.
The Government of Peru has ratified
the International Convention for the Reg-
ulation of Whaling and will shortly de-
posit its instrument of ratification with our
Department of State effective as of the
next IWC meeting in July 1979 or earlier.
The Government of Peru will thus be a
member of the IWC in time to participate
in its next meeting, and the whaling ac-
tivities of Peruvian nationals will be sub-
ject to IWC conservation measures by
that time. In the interim, the Government
of Peru has indicated that Peruvian na-
tionals will not take any sei whales during
the current season. I have also asked the
State Department to work with the Peru-
vian Government in an effort to achieve
interim reductions in sperm and Bryde's
whale quotas.
The Government of Chile is now com-
pleting final arrangements for ratification
of the Convention. The Government of
Chile has indicated that the process will
be completed, and that the instrument of
ratification will be deposited with our De-
partment of State, by the next IWC meet-
ing in July 1979 or earlier, thereby sub-
jecting the whaling activities of Chilean
nationals to the conservation measures of
the IWC as of that time.
In light of these developments, I believe
trade sanctions should not now be im-
posed. In the event the Government of
Chile has not completed its arrangements
to join the IWC or otherwise adhere to
IWC quotas before the next IWC meet-
ing, I intend to reassess this position and
take such additional actions as may be
warranted. I will send to you a supple-
mental report at that time.
