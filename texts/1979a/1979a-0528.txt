of any instrument external to this Treaty."

no assertion that this Treaty prevails over
other Treaties or agreements or that other

as follows:
"Subject to Article 103 of the United
Nations Charter, in the event of a con-
flict between the obligations of the Parties
under the present Treaty and any of their

this Treaty will be binding and imple-
mented."

"The Parties shall agree on the nations
from which the United Nations force and
observers will be drawn. They will be
drawn from nations other than those
which are permanent members of the
United Nations Security Council."
The Parties have agreed as follows:
"With respect to the provisions of para-
graph 8, Article VI, of Annex I, if no
agreement is reached between the Parties,
they will accept or support a U.S. proposal
concerning the composition of the United
Nations force and observers."
ANNEX III
The Treaty of Peace and Annex III
thereto provide for establishing normal
economic relations between the Parties.
In accordance therewith, it is agreed that
such relations will include normal com-
mercial sales of oil by Egypt to Israel, and
that Israel shall be fully entitled to make
bids for Egyptian-origin oil not needed for
Egyptian domestic oil consumption, and
Egypt and its oil concessionaires will en-
tertain bids made by Israel, on the same
basis and terms as apply to other bidders
for such oil.
