Administration of Jimmy Carter, 1979
May 16
I don't think those of you who paid
your own way to come here today realize
what it means to the agency, to me, its
top officers. Running an agency like the
SBA has its bad moments, and we don't
always get good press. We're not always
saluted; we're criticized. But during this
week, when we have 50 of you come here
and demonstrate your success, we meet
your families, we know how you've pros-
pered, it makes it all worthwhile for us.
And we are, all of us, from me down to
the last SBA employee in Washington and
all over the country, are gratified, and our
faith is rekindled by having the chance
to associate with all of you for a few days
in Washington.
We thank you very much.
NOTE: The President spoke at 1:32 p.m. in
the Rose Garden at the White House. Also
attending the ceremony were the winners of
the State and Territorial Small Business
Awards for 1979.
