Vice President Mondale's Visit to
the Nordic Countries and the
Netherlands
Statement Announcing the Trip.
February 5, 1979
At the invitation of the Governments of
the Nordic countries and the Nether-
lands, Vice President Mondale will make
official visits to Iceland, Denmark, Nor-
way, Sweden, Finland, and the Nether-
lands in mid-April.
I have asked the Vice President to serve
as my personal representative during these
visits.
Close and cordial relations with all
these nations are very important to us,
and the Vice President's visit will rein-
force them. We share a great deal in com-
mon, not only because we have the same
democratic ideals and values but because
of close ties of kinship and affection. Four
of these nations-Iceland, Denmark, Nor-
way, and the Netherlands-are NATO
Allies, while two-Sweden and Finlandâ€”
are neutral states whose independence we
respect and with whom we cooperate on
major international issues.
During the course of these visits the
Vice President will review our excellent
bilateral relations, current developments
in Europe, developments in East-West re-
lations, and other international issues of
mutual interest.
NOTE: On the same day, the White House
announced that Mrs. Joan Adams Mondale
will accompany the Vice President on the trip.
