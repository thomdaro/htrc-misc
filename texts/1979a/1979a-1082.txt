reentry vehicles, or fewer penetration
aids, or both, than the maximum number
of reentry vehicles and the maximum
number of penetration aids with which
ICBMs of that type have been flight-
tested as of May 1, 1979, and the de-
crease in launch-weight and throw-
weight in such cases results only from the
reduction in the number of reentry vehi-
cles, or penetration aids, or both, and the
reduction in the quantity of propellant.
Fourth Common Understanding. The
limitations with respect to launch-weight
and throw-weight, provided for in the
Second Agreed Statement and the Sec-
ond Common Understanding to para-
graph 9 of Article IV of the Treaty, do
not preclude the flight-testing or the de-
ployment of ICBMs of the one new type
of light ICBM permitted to each Party
pursuant to paragraph 9 of Article IV of
the Treaty with fewer reentry vehicles,
or fewer penetration aids, or both, than
the maximum number of reentry vehicles
and the maximum number of penetration
aids with which ICBMs of that type have
been flight-tested, even if this results in a
decrease in launch-weight or in throw-
weight in excess of five percent.
In addition to the aforementioned
cases, those limitations do not preclude a
decrease in launch-weight or in throw-
weight in excess of five percent, in the
case of the flight-testing or the deploy-
ment of ICBMs of that type with a lesser
quantity of propellant, including the pro-
pellant of a self-contained dispensing
mechanism or other appropriate device,
than the maximum quantity of propel-
lant, including the propellant of a self-
contained dispensing mechanism or other
appropriate device, with which ICBMs of
that type have been flight-tested, pro-
vided that such an ICBM is at the same
time flight-tested or deployed with fewer
reentry vehicles, or fewer penetration
aids, or both, than the maximum number
of reentry vehicles and the maximum
number of penetration aids with which
ICBMs of that type have been flight-
tested, and the decrease in launch-weight
and throw-weight in such cases results
only from the reduction in the number of
reentry vehicles, or penetration aids, or
both, and the reduction in the quantity of
propellant.
To Paragraph 10 of Article IV of the
Treaty
First Agreed Statement. The following
types of ICBMs and SLBMs equipped
with MIRVs have been flight-tested with
the maximum number of reentry vehicles
set forth below:
For the United States of America
ICBMs of the Minuteman III type-
seven reentry vehicles;
SLBMS of the Poseidon C-3 type-four-
teen reentry vehicles;
SLBMS of the Trident C-4 type-seven
reentry vehicles;
For the Union of Soviet Socialist
Republics
ICBMs of the RS-16 type-four reentry
vehicles;
ICBMs of the RS-18 type-six reentry
vehicles;
ICBMs of the RS-20 type-ten reentry
vehicles;
SLBMs of the RSM-50 type-seven re-
entry vehicles.
Common Understanding. Minuteman III
ICBMs of the United States of America
have been deployed with no more than
three reentry vehicles. During the term
of the Treaty, the United States of Amer-
ica has no plans to and will not flight-test
