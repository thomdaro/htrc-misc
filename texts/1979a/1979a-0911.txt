National Museum Day, 1979
Proclamation 4661. May 18, 1979
By the President of the United States
of America
A Proclamation
Museums are the custodians of a sub-
stantial part of humankind's heritage,
whether produced by the skill of our an-
cestors or by our contemporaries.
Museums are centers of research for
scholars, of education, of enlightenment
for younger generations, and a source of
enjoyment and cultural enhancement for
all.
Museums enrich the quality of our
communities and provide a sense of con-
tinuity and perspective which can en-
hance, in a unique way, the cultural op-
portunities which are provided by schools,
colleges, universities, libraries and other
institutions of learning.
In recognition of the contribution made
by the museums of our Nation to the
preservation of the heritage of the United
States and to the furtherance and under-
standing of the peoples of the United
States the 96th Congress, by House Joint
Resolution 262, has designated May 18,
1979, as National Museum Day.
NOW, THEREFORE, I, JIMMY CARTER,
President of the United States of America,
do hereby proclaim May 18, 1979, as Na-
tional Museum Day, and call upon the
people of the United States, State and lo-
cal government agencies, and interested
organizations to observe that day with
appropriate ceremonies, activities, and
programs.
IN WITNESS WHEREOF, I have here-
unto set my hand this 18th day of May,
in the year
of our Lord nineteen hundred
seventy-nine, and of the Independence of
the United States of America the two hun-
dred and third.
JIMMY CARTER
