Apr. 25
Administration of Jimmy Carter, 1979
of varying kinds of Federal mortgage
money that does, indeed, come through
the Farm Home Administration, the
veterans programs, the FHA, through
HUD. And also, as you know, with the
new money certificates, we have stabilized
the available supply of money for home
construction even in spite of the very high
interest rates which would formerly have
put the housing construction industry al-
most in a recession.
I don't know of any additional new
programs that are in prospect of being
evolved. I have not proposed any to the
Congress. Can you ask me one followup
question about the specific kind of mort-
gage money to which you refer?
Q. We'll take any kind, anything.
[Laughter]
THE PRESIDENT. That's a good answer.
Well, I thank you. But those home pro-
grams are being maintained. And as I
said earlier, because of various factors, we
have sustained, for this past 2 years, since
I have been in office, I think the highest
level of home construction in history, in
spite of the very high interest rates. This
has been one of the causes of inflation, by
the way, because so many homes have
been built, I think an average of 2.2 mil-
lion homes each of the 2 years.
We have cut the unemployment rate in
the construction trade down 35 percent,
because people have gone back to work
building homes. And, of course, the lum-
ber industry, the timber industry, the
sheetrock industry, the insulation industry
has done extremely well. In some cases a
demand for these building supplies has
been greater than the supply. And that's
one of the industries where prices have
gone up very high.
But we'll try to do all we can to chan-
nel more mortgage money to the seacoast
area.
Thank you very much.
Q. Thank you, Mr. President.
THE PRESIDENT. Yes, ma'am?
AMY CARTER
Q. Hello, Mr. President. I was wonder-
ing, does Amy boast or brag because
you're the President of the United States?
[Laughter]
THE PRESIDENT. I was trying to re-
member a time when she's ever boasted
or bragged. [Laughter]
No, I don't believe so. I think the only
time in the last 2 years that I can recall
is the morning after I got back from the
Middle East, Amy got up early and came
in where I wasâ€”we had got in long after
midnight-and she crawled up on the
bed with me and said, "Daddy, I'm proud
that you are my father, and I'm proud
that you're President." But ordinarily,
Amy, being the daughter of a President,
probably does more apologizing than she
does bragging. [Laughter]
You didn't tell me what your name
was.
Q. Paloma Kressmann.
THE PRESIDENT. Paloma?
Q. Yes, sir.
THE PRESIDENT. Crestman-that's a
pretty name. Do you ever come to Wash-
ington, Paloma?
Q. No. [Laughter]
THE PRESIDENT. Perhaps you could
come sometime and see both me and
Amy. Would you like to do that?
Q. Yes.
THE PRESIDENT. Okay. Well, I'd like
you to come. Is your last name Crestman,
C-r-e-s-t-m-a-n?
Q. What do you want me to do?
[Laughter]
THE PRESIDENT. I want you to come to
see me. But I asked how do you spell your
last name. Is it-
Q. K-r-e-s-s-m-a-n-n.
