Administration of Jimmy Carter, 1979
June 12
to the Constitution and the statutes of the
United States (including section 203 of
the Trade Act of 1974 (19 U.S.C. 2253)
(the Trade Act)), the imposition of
temporary quantitative limitations on the
importation into the United States of
certain articles of stainless steel or alloy
tool steel. These limitations were effective
as to those articles entered, or withdrawn
from warehouse, for consumption on or
after June 14, 1976, and were to continue
for a period of three years from that date
unless earlier modified, or terminated.
Proclamation 4445 was subsequently
modified by Proclamation 4477 of No-
vember 16, 1976, Proclamation 4509 of
June 15, 1977, and Proclamation 4559 of
April 5, 1978. Import relief currently in
effect under Proclamation 4445,
amended, with respect to articles pro-
vided for in items 923.20 through 923.26,
inclusive, of the Tariff Schedules of the
United States (TSUS) (19 U.S.C. 1202),
is scheduled to terminate at the close of
June 13, 1979, unless extended by the
President pursuant to section 203 (h) (3)
of the Trade Act (19 U.S.C. 2253 (h)
(3)).
2. Pursuant to sections 203 (i) (2) and
(i) (3) of the Trade Act (19 U.S.C.
2253 (i) (2) and (i) (3)), the United
States International Trade Commission
(USITC), on April 24, 1979, reported to
the President (USITC Report 203-5)
the results of its investigation under sec-
tion 203 (i) of the Trade Act (19 U.S.C.
2253 (i)). The USITC advised that it
was evenly divided on the question of the
probable economic effect on the domes-
tic industry concerned of the termina-
tion of the import relief provided for in
items 923.20 through 923.26, inclusive, of
the TSUS.
3. Section 203 (h) (3) of the Trade Act
(19 U.S.C. 2253 (h) (3)) provides that
any import relief provided pursuant to
section 203 may be extended by the Presi-
dent, at a level of relief no greater than
the level in effect immediately before such
extension, if the President determines,
after taking into account the advice re-
ceived from the USITC under section
203 (i) (2) of the Trade Act (19 U.S.C.
2253 (i) (2)) and after taking into ac-
count the considerations described in sec-
tion 202(c) of the Trade Act (19 U.S.C.
2252 (c)), that such extension is in the
national interest.
4. In accordance with section 203 (h)
(3) of the Trade Act (19 U.S.C. 2253
(h) (3)), having taken into account the
advice received from the USITC under
section 203 (i) (2) of the Trade Act (19
U.S.C. 2253(i) (2)), and the considera-
tions described in section 202(c) of the
Trade Act (19 U.S.C. 2252(c)), I have
determined that the extension of the im-
port relief provided for in items 923.20
through 923.26, inclusive, of the TSUS is
in the national interest.
NOW, THEREFORE, I, JIMMY CARTER,
President of the United States of Amer-
ica, acting under the authority vested in
me by the Constitution and the statutes
of the United States, including section
203 of the Trade Act (19 U.S.C. 2253),
and in accordance with Article XIX of
the General Agreement on Tariffs and
Trade (GATT) (61 Stat. (pt. 5) A58;
8 UST (pt. 2) 1786), do proclaim
that-
(1) Items 608.52, 608.76, 608.78,
608.85, 608.88, 609.06, 609.07 and
609.08, in Part I of Schedule XX to the
GATT are modified to conform with the
Quantitative restrictions set forth in the
Annex to this proclamation.
(2) Subpart A, part 2 of the Appendix
to the TSUS is modified as set forth in
the Annex to this proclamation.
