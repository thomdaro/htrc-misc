Airey Neave
of the United Kingdom on the Death of the
Message to Prime Minister James Callaghan
Conservative Party Member of Parliament.
March 31, 1979
I have been deeply shocked by the
murder of Airey Neave. It is an outrage
to civilized values. Such violence does not
contribute in any way to the resolution
of political problems and must be ab-
horred by all men of conscience every-
where. Please convey my deepest con-
dolences and those of my fellow Ameri-
cans to Mr. Neave's family and his parlia-
mentary colleagues.

Remarks at a Fundraising Reception for
Representative David R. Obey.
March 31, 1979
Senator Nelson, Congressman Dave Obey,
Congressman Reuss, Congressman Baldus,
and Congressman McHugh from New
York, Chairman White, and my good
friend Ambassador Pat Lucey, friends of
David Obey and, I hope, friends of mine:
There are 535 Members of the House
and Senate. A President does not have
time to visit many congressional districts
in this Nation, personally, to support and
to endorse a Member of the Congress.
This allotment of the time and interest of
the President has to be very carefully
chosen and apportioned. But there was
no doubt in my mind, when I had an op-
portunity to come here, that it was a
sound investment, because it is so crucial
to our Nation that David Obey stay in the
Congress and continue to serve you, the
President, and our country.
