Meeting With Federal
Government Employees
Remarks and a Question-and-Answer
Session With 13 Employees. May 21, 1979
THE PRESIDENT. First of all, I would like
to welcome you here to the Cabinet
Room. We had a meeting this morning
with some of your bosses. We meet here
every 2 weeks with the full Cabinet and
the major agency leaders, and then, in be-
tween, I have important meetings like this,
when we discuss matters of domestic and
foreign consequence to our Nation.
Today, however, is a special occasion
for me to have a chance to meet with a
broader, representative group of career
civil servants in our Government. You
have been chosen, I think almost every
one of you, perhaps everyone, because of
outstanding achievement. And you've re-
ceived awards for a special contribution
to make our own Federal Government
more effective and more efficient and a
greater credit to me and to the country.
ADMINISTRATION POLICIES
I think it's accurate to point out that in
the last 22 years, I've been privileged to
be part of the system which represents the
American people in our Government, and
I've recognized with a growing degree of
appreciation the high quality and dedica-
tion of the overwhelming majority of
people in the civil service system and in
the administrative positions as well.
I know that you represent the Armed
Forces, you represent the farmers, you
represent the children in the schools, you
represent people who are handicapped,
you represent those who are looking for
good housing, you represent the taxpayers,
and you represent others who have per-
haps only one contact with the Federal
Government as a principal source of ad-
vice and counsel if they are in a profes-
