Reduction in Energy Use by the
Federal Government
Memorandum From the President.
April 10, 1979
Memorandum for the Heads of Execu-
tive Departments and Agencies
Subject: Required 5% Reduction in
Agency Energy Use
The U.S. has taken the lead to get the
member nations of the International
Energy Agency to reduce petroleum con-
sumption. Our goal, as part of this com-
mitment, is to reduce oil imports by a level
equal and up to 5% of projected domestic
consumption. This goal must be met to
help reduce the upward pressure on world
oil prices.
The Federal Government will do its
part. I am directing that Executive de-
partments and agencies reduce energy
consumption by 5% for the twelve-month
period beginning April 1, 1979, as com-
pared with the preceding twelve months.
In achieving this reduction, the follow-
ing specific actions are to be taken:
Set thermostats in all Federally-
Each agency will have to take addi-
tional steps to achieve the full 5% reduc-
tion goal. These initiatives should be
selected so as to avoid adverse program-
matic impacts. As directed in my Febru-
ary 2, 1979 memorandum, for example,
heads of agencies may reduce lighting and
other electrical use throughout agency
activities and reduce petroleum use by
eliminating unnecessary activities and ve-
hicle trips. Credit will be given for fuel
switching from oil to gas or coal.
Within 30 days, please submit to the
Secretary of Energy a plan for achieving
the reduction in energy use. Each agency
that now reports quarterly energy con-
sumption to the Secretary of Energy
should identify in the quarterly status re-
ports the actual energy savings attribut-
able to this effort.
I have directed the Secretary of Energy,
in consultation with the Office of Man-
agement and Budget, to monitor compli-
ance with the provisions of this directive.
They will periodically report to me on ac-
complishments, problems with respect to
adverse impacts on agency missions, and
further actions which may be required.
