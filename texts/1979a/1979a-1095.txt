Administration of Jimmy Carter, 1979
June 18
I, as President, am entrusted with the
security of the United States of America.
I would never take any action that would
jeopardize that sacred trust. President
Brezhnev, you and I both have children
and grandchildren, and we want them to
live and to live in peace. We have both
worked hard to give our own and our
own nations' children that security.
pledge now, all together, to use this treaty
as we continue our passage to peace.
NOTE: The exchange began at 1:02 p.m. in
the Redoutens√§le at the Hofburg, the imperial
palace. President Brezhnev spoke in Russian,

Each of us has only one nation. We both
share the same world. Not one nation on
this Earth, not one people, not one single
human being is harmed or threatened or
deprived by this victory in the battle for
peace. Indeed, a victory is here today for
