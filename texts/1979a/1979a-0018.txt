Jan. 4
Administration of Jimmy Carter, 1979
U.S.C. 2251(d) (1)), the United States
International Trade Commission, herein-
after referred to as the USITC, on
November 3, 1978, reported to the Presi-
dent (USITC Report 201-37) the results
of its investigation under section 201 (b)
of the Trade Act (19 U.S.C. 2251(b)).
The USITC determined that certain bolts,
nuts and screws of iron or steel provided
for in items 646.49, 646.54, 646.56, and
646.63 of the Tariff Schedules of the
United States (TSUS) are being im-
ported into the United States in such
increased quantities as to be a substantial
cause of serious injury, or the threat there-
of, to the domestic industry producing
articles like or directly competitive with
the imported articles. The USITC rec-
ommended the imposition of additional
duties on imports of the above specified
articles.
2. On December 22, 1978, pursuant to
section 202(b) (1) of the Trade Act (19
U.S.C. 2252(b)(1)), and after taking
into account the considerations specified
in section 202(c) of the Trade Act (19
U.S.C. 2252 (c)), I determined to prevent
or remedy the injury or threat thereof
found to exist by the USITC through the
proclamation of a temporary duty in-
crease different from that recommended
by the USITC. On December 22, 1978, in
accordance with section 203(b) (1) of the
Trade Act (19 U.S.C. 2253(b)(1)), I
transmitted a report to the Congress set-
ting forth my determination and intention
to proclaim a temporary duty increase and
stating the reasons why my decision dif-
fered from the action recommended by
the USITC.
3. The bolts and nuts provided for in
items 646.54 and 646.56 of the TSUS are
currently eligible for duty-free treatment
under the Generalized System of Prefer-
ences (GSP), and section 503 (c) (2) of
the Trade Act (19 U.S.C. 2463 (c) (2))
provides that no article shall be eligible
for purposes of the GSP for any period
during which such article is the subject
of any action proclaimed pursuant to sec-
tion 203 of the Trade Act (19 U.S.C.
2253).
4. Section 203 (e) (1) of the Trade Act
(19 U.S.C. 2253 (e) (1)) requires that im-
port relief be proclaimed and take effect
within 15 days after the import relief
determination date.
5. Pursuant to sections 203 (a) (1), 203
(e) (1), and 503 (c) (2) of the Trade Act
(19 U.S.C. 2253 (a) (1), 2253 (e) (1), and
2463 (c) (2)), I am providing import re-
lief, as hereinafter proclaimed, through
the temporary increase of import duty on,
and, where applicable, the removal from
eligibility for duty-free entry under the
GSP, of the bolts, nuts and screws of iron
or steel covered by the affirmative finding
of the USITC.
NOW, THEREFORE, I, JIMMY CARTER,
President of the United States of America,
acting under the authority vested in me by
the Constitution and the statutes of the
United States, including General Head-
note 4 of the TSUS (19 U.S.C. 1202),
sections 203, 503 and 604 of the Trade
Act (19 U.S.C. 2253, 2463, and 2483),
and in accordance with Articles I and
XIX of the General Agreement on Tariffs
and Trade (GATT) (61 Stat. (pt. 5)
A12 and 61 Stat. (pt. 5) A58; 8 UST
(pt. 2) 1786), do proclaim that-
(1) Part I of Schedule XX to the
GATT is modified to conform to the
action taken in the Annex to this
proclamation.
(2) Subpart A, part 2 of the Appendix
to the TSUS is modified as set forth in
the Annex to this proclamation.
(3) GSP eligibility is removed for the
bolts and nuts covered by items 923.51
