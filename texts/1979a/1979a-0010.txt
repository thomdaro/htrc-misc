Preface
A companion publication to the Public Papers series, the Weekly Compila-
tion of Presidential Documents, was begun in 1965 to provide a broader range
of Presidential materials on a more timely basis to meet the needs of the contem-
porary reader. Beginning with the administration of Jimmy Carter, the Public
Papers series expanded its coverage to include all material as printed in the Weekly
Compilation. That coverage provides a listing of the President's daily schedule
and meetings, when announced, and other items of general interest issued by the
White House Press Office. Also included are lists of the President's nominations
submitted to the Senate, materials released by the Press Office which are not
printed full-text in the book, and acts approved by the President. This information
is compiled on a weekly basis and appears at the end of each week's coverage.
Volumes covering the administrations of Presidents Hoover, Truman,
Eisenhower, Kennedy, Johnson, Nixon, and Ford are also available.
This series is under the direction of Ernest J. Galdi, Acting Director, Office
of the Federal Register, and is produced by the Presidential Documents Division,
Robert E. Lewis, Director, and Richard L. Claypoole, Deputy Director. Editors
of this book were Katherine A. Mellody, Kenneth R. Payne, Brian L. Hermes,
and Gwendolyn J. Henderson.
White House liaison was provided by Patricia Y. Bario, Deputy Press
Secretary. The frontispiece and photographs used in the portfolio were supplied
by the White House Photo Office.
The typography and design of the volume were developed by the United
States Government Printing Office under the direction of John J. Boyle, Public
Printer.
