same designation, a light ICBM that
has been flight-tested with multiple in-
dependently targetable reentry
hicles;
Missiles of the type designated by
the United States of America as the
Poseidon C-3 and known to the Union
of Soviet Socialist Republics by the
same designation, an SLBM that was
first flight-tested in 1968 and that has
been flight-tested with multiple inde-
pendently targetable reentry vehicles;
Missiles of the type designated by the
United States of America as the Tri-
dent C-4 and known to the Union of
Soviet Socialist Republics by the same
designation, an SLBM that was first
flight-tested in 1977 and that has been
flight-tested with multiple independ-
ently targetable reentry vehicles;
Missiles of the type designated by
the Union of Soviet Socialist Republics
as the RS-16 and known to the United
States of America as the SS-17, a light
ICBM that has been flight-tested with
a single reentry vehicle and with multi-
ple independently targetable reentry
vehicles;
Missiles of the type designated by the
Union of Soviet Socialist Republics as
the RS-18 and known to the United
States of America as the SS-19, the

throw-weight of light ICBMs, which
has been flight-tested with a single re-
entry vehicle and with multiple inde-
pendently targetable reentry vehicles;
Missiles of the type designated by the
Union of Soviet Socialist Republics as
the RS-20 and known to the United
States of America as the SS-18, the

with a single reentry vehicle and with
multiple independently targetable re-
entry vehicles.
Third Agreed Statement. Reentry vehi-
cles are independently targetable:
(a) if, after separation from the
booster, maneuvering and target-
ing of the reentry vehicles to sep-
arate aim points along trajectories
which are unrelated to each other
are accomplished by means of de-
vices which are installed in a self-
contained dispensing mechanism
or on the reentry vehicles, and
which are based on the use of
electronic or other computers in
combination with devices using
jet engines, including rocket en-
gines, or aerodynamic systems;
(b) if maneuvering and targeting of
the reentry vehicles to separate
aim points along trajectories
which are unrelated to each other
are accomplished by means of
other devices which may be de-
veloped in the future.
Fourth Common Understanding. For
the purposes of this Treaty, all ICBM
launchers in the Derazhnya and Pervo-
