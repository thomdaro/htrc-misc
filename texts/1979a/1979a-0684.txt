Apr. 15
Administration of Jimmy Carter, 1979
We used to come down here before I
was Governor and stay with Fred Marlin,
Dr. Marlin, that they had stand up. We
used to kind of camp in his house, he and
his wife and, I think, two children. When
I was Governor, I came back.
It's a beautiful island. I've been to al-
most all the Georgia islands.
Q. What have you been doing since you
got to Sapelo Island? We haven't gotten
much information about that.
THE PRESIDENT. Well, I always jog
every day. I've read four or five books.
Every morning I have a good bit of
paperwork to do, the daily briefing from
the State Department, from Secretary
Vance, and the daily briefing on intelli-
gence. That comes in early every morn-
Q. You nod, huh?
THE PRESIDENT. Very good.
Q. How do you like your house that
you're staying in?
THE PRESIDENT. Well, it's beautiful.
Q. Is it as elaborate as it once was?
THE PRESIDENT. I guess so.
Q. What were the books, sir, that you
said you read?
THE PRESIDENT. Well, I have no com-
ment. [Laughter] There's an extensive
library in the mansion there, I guess a
couple thousand books. I read one of a,
kind of a collection of Hemingway's
stories, "Death in the Afternoon."
Message to President Josip Broz Tito.
April 15, 1979
ing. And I get a memorandum from the Earthquake in Yugoslavia
National Security Council as well, almost
every day. And then documents to sign,
appointments of people to positions in
government. And we've had several
emergency declarations to complete in
the areas where the tornadoes have done
damage.
Q. Are you worried about the Rho-
desian situation?
THE PRESIDENT. Well, I've been keep-
ing up with it, both through the news
media and also through the daily briefings
we get.
Q. Anything to say about the spy plane
in South Africa?
THE PRESIDENT. No, I think not. I
don't want to make any international
news. [Laughter]
Q. You're going to enhance the tourist
trade, but they can't come here, can they?
[Laughter]
THE PRESIDENT. No. I hope you all
have a chance to drive around and take
a look at the island.
Q. They won't let us. You won't let us.
[Laughter]
THE PRESIDENT. Right. Right.
Dear Mr. President:
I was distressed to learn of the violent
earthquake which struck the southern
coast of Yugoslavia earlier today. Please
accept my deepest sympathy and that of
my family in the face of this tragic event.
I have asked Ambassador Eagleburger to
convey to Mr. Veljko Milativic, President
of the Presidency of the Socialist Republic
of Montenegro, and through him to the
families of the victims, my personal con-
dolences and those of the American
people.
The United States stands ready to assist
in efforts to relieve the suffering. I have
instructed Ambassador Eagleburger to re-
main in close touch with the appropriate
authorities to determine how we may best
be of assistance.
Again, Mr. President, please accept my
deepest sympathy and condolences.
JIMMY CARTER
