Multilateral Trade Negotiations
Message to the Congress Transmitting
Proposed Legislation. January 15, 1979
To the Congress of the United States:
I am today transmitting to the Con-
gress a proposal for legislation to extend
until September 30, 1979, the authority of
the Secretary of the Treasury under Sec-
tion 303 (d) of the Tariff Act of 1930 to
waive the application of countervailing
duties. The Secretary's authority to waive
the imposition of countervailing duties
expired on January 2, 1979. Expansion of
this authority is essential to provide the
Congress with time to consider the results
of the Tokyo Round of Multilateral
Trade Negotiations (MTN). Failure to
extend this authority is likely to prevent
the reaching of a conclusion to these ne-
gotiations and could set back our national
economic interests. Accordingly, I urge
that the Congress enact the necessary leg-
ANNE P. JONES to be a member of the Federal islation at the earliest possible date.

As stipulated by the Congress in the
Trade Act of 1974, negotiation of a satis-
factory code on subsidies and counter-
vailing duties has been a primary U.S.
objective in the Tokyo Round. We have
sought an agreement to improve disci-
pline on the use of subsidies which ad-
versely affect trade. I am pleased to re-
port that in recent weeks our negotiators
have substantially concluded negotiations
for a satisfactory subsidy/countervailing
duty code which includes: (1) new rules
on the use of internal and export subsi-
