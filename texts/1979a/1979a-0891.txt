Alaska Public Lands Legislation
Statement on the House of Representatives
Approval of the Legislation. May 16, 1979
I am pleased and gratified by today's
action on Alaska lands by the House of
Representatives. The full House voted
overwhelmingly to pass the Udall-Ander-
son bill, which I strongly supported.
This bill allows for development of most
of Alaska's oil, gas, mineral, and timber
resources, while preserving what is essen-
tial to Alaska's native cultures, scenic
wonders, and abundant wildlife. Members
of the House should feel justifiably proud
of their historic vote for a truly superior
bill.
Now that the House has acted firmly
and properly to protect Alaska lands, I
hope that the Senate will move promptly
to take similar action. I have taken a num-
ber of steps to protect Alaska lands in the
event acceptable legislation is not finally
enacted by the Congress. However, I
deeply hope that the Congress as a whole
will take the opportunity to act in the
interest of the entire Nation and pass an
Alaska bill designed to serve future
generations.
