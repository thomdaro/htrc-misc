Administration of Jimmy Carter, 1979
Small Business which I have called for in
January of 1980. This year, every small
business man and woman and indeed,
every American, should be giving serious
thought to how we may best secure and
expand the small business sector of our
economy in the years ahead.
Now, THEREFORE, I, JIMMY CARTER,
President of the United States of America,
do hereby proclaim the week beginning
May 13, 1979, as Small Business Week,
and I call on every American to join me
in this very special tribute.
IN WITNESS WHEREOF, I have here-
unto set my hand this twenty-third day
of February, in the year of our Lord nine-
teen hundred seventy-nine, and of the In-
dependence of the United States of Amer-
ica the two hundred and third.

Meat Imports
Proclamation 4642. February 26, 1979
QUANTITATIVE LIMITATION ON THE
IMPORTATION OF CERTAIN MEAT
By the President of the United States
of America
A Proclamation
The Act of August 22, 1964 (78 Stat.
594; 19 U.S.C. 1202 note), provides for
the limitation of certain meat imports if
import estimates exceed 110 percent of an
adjusted base quantity for that year. The
limitation applies to fresh, chilled, or
frozen cattle meat and fresh, chilled, or
frozen meat of goats and sheep, except
lamb.
The Secretary of Agriculture has deter-
mined in accordance with Section 2(b)
(1) of the Act that the adjusted base
quantity of meat for the calendar year
1979 is 1131.6 million pounds. The Secre-
tary has estimated (in the 1979 first quar-
terly estimate, 44 FR 1202) that the ag-
gregate imports of meat for 1979 will be
1570.0 million pounds. This estimate ex-
ceeds 110 percent of the adjusted base
quantity for 1979.
In accordance with Section 2(c) of the
Act, the President must limit the import
of meat to the adjusted base quantity for
1979 of 1131.6 million pounds, unless he
increases or suspends that limitation pur-
suant to Section 2 (d) of the Act.
Now, THEREFORE, I, JIMMY CARTER,
President of the United States of America,
by the authority vested in me by Section 2
of the Act, do hereby proclaim as follows:
1. The total quantity of the articles
specified in item 106.10 (relating to fresh,
chilled, or frozen meat) and item 106.20
(relating to fresh, chilled, or frozen meat
of goats and sheep (except lamb)) of part
2B, schedule 1 of the Tariff Schedules of
the United States, which may be entered,
or withdrawn from warehouse, for con-
sumption during the calendar year 1979,
is limited to 1131.6 million pounds.
2. In accordance with Section 2(d) of
the Act, I determine that the supply of
meat described in Paragraph 1 hereof will
be inadequate to meet domestic demand
at reasonable prices.
3. The limitation proclaimed in Para-
graph 1 hereof is suspended during calen-
dar year 1979, which suspension shall re-
main in effect unless because of changed
circumstances it becomes necessary to take
further action under the Act, and I hereby
determine that the suspension for such
