The White House Fellowship program
was established in 1964 to provide out-
standing Americans with firsthand experi-
ence in the process of governing the Na-
tion. It is open to U.S. citizens, early in
their careers, from all occupations and
professions. Employees of the Federal
Government are not eligible, with the ex-
ception of career Armed Forces personnel.
In addition to their job assignments
with the Vice President, members of the
Cabinet, and with the White House staff,
the Fellows participate in an education
program that includes off-the-record dis-
cussions with top-level Government offi-
cials, journalists, and leaders from various
other segments of private life.
Leadership, intellectual and profes-
sional ability, and a commitment to com-
munity and Nation are broad criteria em-
ployed in the selection process.
