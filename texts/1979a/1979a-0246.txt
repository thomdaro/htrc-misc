fatal poisonings, according to the latest
figures from the National Center for
Health Statistics.
Ingestions by youngsters of household
products sold in safety packaging were
down as well. But, because not all sub-
stances can be packaged safely, it is up
to everyone responsible for child care to
guard against these dangers in the way
we store, handle, and dispose of poten-
tially hazardous household products.
Accordingly, by joint resolution of Sep-
tember 26, 1961 (75 Stat. 681, 36 U.S.C.
165), Congress has requested the Presi-
dent to issue annually a proclamation
designating the third week in March as
National Poison Prevention Week.
NOW, THEREFORE, I, JIMMY CARTER,
President of the United States of Amer-
ica, designate the week beginning March
18, 1979, as National Poison Prevention
Week. It is particularly important during
this International Year of the Child that
we become aware of this specific need
for child protection.
IN WITNESS WHEREOF, I have here-
unto set my hand this eighth day of Feb-
ruary, in the year of our Lord nineteen
hundred seventy-nine, and of the Inde-
pendence of the United States of Amer-
ica the two hundred and third.

Letter to the Speaker of the House and the
President of the Senate Transmitting a Report.
February 8, 1979
Dear Mr. Speaker: (Dear Mr. President:)
In accordance with section 203(b) (1)
of the Trade Act of 1974, enclosed is a
report to the Congress setting forth my
decision to provide import relief on wood
and plastic clothespins in the form of a
price-bracketed quota.
Sincerely,

IMPORT RELIEF ACTION
CLOTHESPINS
As required under section 203 (b) (2)
of the Trade Act of 1974, I am trans-
forth the action I will take with respect to
mitting this report to Congress setting
wood and plastic clothespins covered by
the affirmative finding on December 12,
1978 of the U.S. International Trade
Commission (USITC) under section 201
(d) (1) of the Trade Act.
After considering all relevant aspects
of the case, including those considerations
set forth in section 202 (c) of the Trade
Act of 1974, I have decided to authorize
import relief which is a variation on the
relief recommended by the USITC. With-
in 15 days, I will issue a Presidential
Proclamation authorizing the imposition
of a three-year, global quota on wooden
and plastic spring clothespins (TSUS
790.05) with a dutiable value of not more
than $1.70 per gross. The quota, admin-
istered quarterly on a pro rata basis, will
be broken down as follows:
Category
Valued not over 80 cents per
gross
Yearly quota
allocation
Valued over 80 cents per gross but
not over $1.35 per gross‒‒‒‒‒‒‒
Valued over $1.35 per gross but not
over $1.70 per gross--.

During the course of each year, as it
becomes apparent that the quota for any
price bracket will not be filled for the
year, then the remainder of the alloca-
