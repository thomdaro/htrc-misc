Administration of Jimmy Carter, 1979
Jan. 22
The Federal Government cannot over-
come inflation by itself. Success will re-
quire cooperation from business, from
labor, from consumers, from State and
local governments-in short, from every-
one. I have called for that cooperation as
part of my anti-inflation program. How-
ever, only through its leadership and its
example can the Federal Government
secure this cooperation. This budget pro-
vides that leadership. It restrains Govern-
ment's demand on the economy. At the
same time, it makes the Federal dollar
work harder and better.
The key to effective Federal leadership
against inflation, unemployment, and
poverty lies in more effective allocation
and management of available resources.
We must reduce the growth of total Fed-
eral spending while protecting the security
of our Nation and the well-being of the
American people.
This budget provides the necessary
discipline over Federal spending by:
eliminating programs that are
unworkable;
-improving programs to make them
more effective;
-focusing assistance on the disadvan-
taged and the poor; and
-reorganizing and consolidating Fed-
eral activities to improve efficiency
and avoid waste, abuse, or misman-
agement.
I believe this discipline represents an
opportunity to reassess and build strong
foundations for future Government ac-
tivity, an opportunity to change Govern-
ment for the better. It is my firm intention
to continue these policies in future years,
to reduce the size of the deficit, and to
achieve a balanced budget as soon as eco-
nomic conditions permit.
My budget provides for total outlays

in 1980 of $532 billion, an increase of $38
billion, or 7.7%, over 1979, and receipts
of $503 billion. For 1981 and 1982, it pro-
vides for total outlays of $578 billion and
$615 billion, respectively. Budget outlays
will decrease as a share of the Nation's
gross national product from 22.1% in
1978 to 21.2% in 1980 and 20.3% in 1982.
This reduction in the share of our na-
tional product spent by the Federal Gov-
ernment is a fundamental goal of my
policy, equally as important as reducing
the deficit.
The expenditures I recommend are
specifically focused on overcoming our
Nation's crucial problems. Through rig-
orous zero-base analyses, priorities have
been established to help us get the best
Government possible for the resources we
can afford. Careful attention to efficiency
and productivity will enable Federal man-
agers to achieve our most important pri-
orities with less money and fewer people.
