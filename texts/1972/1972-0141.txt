courage and assist recipients to be-
come self-supporting.
Its benefits are inadequate to the
needs of its recipients.
It encourages families to break up so
that they might qualify for assistance.
Its 54 different systems with diverse
standards defy efficient administra-
tion and create severe inequities.
I urge that the Congress approve
promptly the Administration's Workfare
legislative proposal. My proposal would
remove the greatest evils of the present
system by:
-emphasizing work incentives, work
requirements, job training and public
employment opportunities, child
care, and reform of social service pro-
grams to encourage families to be-
come and remain self-supporting;
-providing benefits for the first time
to families with fathers who work but
who do not earn enough to provide a
decent standard of living for the
family;
-setting a national minimum income
standard for all families with chil-
dren in America;
-establishing uniform national eligi-
bility standards;
-reducing the fiscal pressure on States
caused by rapidly rising welfare ex-
penditures; and
-raising income limits to allow retired
persons to earn more without loss of
benefits.
NUTRITION FOR THE NEEDY.-This Ad-
ministration has taken decisive steps to
feed the hungry and eliminate malnutri-
tion in America. Most importantly, major
reforms of the Food Stamp program that
I proposed are now in operation. New
regulations will:
-establish uniform eligibility standards
that equal or exceed the present State
standards in all States;
-concentrate benefits on those most
in need;
-guarantee family stamp allotments
for the needy large enough to pur-
chase a nutritionally adequate diet,
with increases tied to the cost of liv-
ing; and
-provide a work requirement for those
able to work.
As a result of these and earlier Admin-
istration actions, we have provided more
benefits to more people in need than ever
before. Food stamp outlays have in-
creased ninefold from 1969 to 1973-
reaching an estimated $2.3 billion in bene-
fits for 13 million poor in 1973.
In addition, there will be nearly a
threefold increase between 1969 and 1973
in the number of needy schoolchildren
receiving subsidized lunches.
A NEW DIGNITY FOR THE AGING.-Last
November, I convened the White House
Conference on Aging to develop proposals
for improving the lives of our senior citi-
zens. The recommendations of the Con-
ference clearly indicate that programs to
aid the aged should serve two essential
purposes.

·
They should provide the aged with
sufficient income and necessary serv-
ices to permit them to remain in-
dependent.
They should assist aged citizens to live
active and useful lives.
This budget is responsive to these rec-
ommendations. In 1973, the Federal Gov-
ernment will spend nearly $50 billion to
assist the Nation's 21 million aged per-
sons. This is $16 billion more than the
amount spent to assist the aging in 1969.
