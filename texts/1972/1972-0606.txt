protecting our own remaining forces
and in assisting the South Vietnamese
in their efforts to protect their homes
and their country from a Communist
takeover.
General Abrams predicts in this re-
port that there will be several more
weeks of very hard fighting. Some
battles will be lost, he says; others
will be won by the South Vietnamese.
But his conclusion is that if we con-
tinue to provide air and sea support,
the enemy will fail in its desperate
gamble to impose a Communist
regime in South Vietnam, and the
South Vietnamese will then have
demonstrated their ability to defend
themselves on the ground against fu-
ture enemy attacks.
Based on this realistic assessment from
General Abrams, and after consultation
with President Thieu,
Thieu, Ambassador
Bunker, Ambassador Porter, and my sen-
ior advisers in Washington, I have three
decisions to announce tonight.
First, I have decided that Vietnamiza-
tion has proved itself sufficiently that we
can continue our program of withdrawing
American forces without detriment to our
overall goal of ensuring South Vietnam's
survival as an independent country. Con-
sequently, I am announcing tonight that
over the next 2 months 20,000 more
Americans will be brought home from
Vietnam. This decision has the full ap-
proval of President Thieu and of General
Abrams. It will bring our troop ceiling
down to 49,000 by July 1-a reduction of
half a million men since this Administra-
tion came into office.
Second, I have directed Ambassador
Porter to return to the negotiating table
in Paris tomorrow, but with one very
specific purpose in mind. We are not
resuming the Paris talks simply in order
to hear more empty propaganda and
bombast from the North Vietnamese and
Vietcong delegates, but to get on with the
constructive business of making peace.
We are resuming the Paris talks with the
firm expectation that productive talks
leading to rapid progress will follow
through all available channels. As far as
we are concerned, the first order of busi-
ness will be to get the enemy to halt his
invasion of South Vietnam and to return
the American prisoners of war.
Finally, I have ordered that our air
and naval attacks on military installations
in North Vietnam be continued until the
North Vietnamese stop their offensive in
South Vietnam.
I have flatly rejected the proposal that
we stop the bombing of North Vietnam as
a condition for returning to the negotiat-
ing table. They sold that package to the
United States once before, in 1968, and
we are not going to buy it again in 1972.
Now, let's look at the record. By July 1
we will have withdrawn over 90 percent
of our forces that were in Vietnam in 1969.
Before the enemy's invasion began, we
had cut our air sorties in half. We have
offered exceedingly generous terms for
peace. The only thing we have refused to
do is to accede to the enemy's demand
to overthrow the lawfully constituted
ยน On April 25, 1972, Press Secretary Ronald
L. Ziegler announced an agreement by the
United States and the Republic of Vietnam to
resume the plenary sessions of the Paris peace
talks. The announcement is printed in the
