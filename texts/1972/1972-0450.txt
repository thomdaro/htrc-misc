TOWARD A BETTER HEALTH CARE
SYSTEM
Working together, this Administration
and the Congress already have taken some
significant strides in our mutual determi-
nation to provide the best, and the most
widely available, health care system the
world has ever known.
The time now has come to take the
final steps to reorganize, to revitalize and
to redirect American health care-to
build on its historic accomplishments, to
close its gaps and to provide it with the
incentives and sustenance to move toward
a more perfect mission of human com-
passion.
I believe that the health care resources
of America in 1972, if strengthened and
expanded as I have proposed in this
Message, will be more than sufficient to
75
move us significantly toward that great
goal.
If the Administration and the Congress
continue to act together-and act on the
major proposals this year, as I strongly
again urge then the 1970s will be re-
membered as an era in which the United
States took the historic step of making the
health of the entire population not only
a great goal but a practical objective.
