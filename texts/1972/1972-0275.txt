of the future collide-can nevertheless
move from antagonism to communication
to understanding.
On January 20, 1969 in my Inaugural
Address, I defined our approach toward
all potential adversaries:
"After a period of confrontation, we
are entering an era of negotiation.
"Let all nations know that during this
Administration our lines of communica-
tion will be open.
"We seek an open world-open to ideas,
open to the exchange of goods and peo-
ple-a world in which no people, great or
small, will live in angry isolation.
"We cannot expect to make everyone
our friend, but we can try to make no one
our enemy."
When I spoke those lines, I had the
People's Republic of China very much in
mind. It is this attitude that shaped our
policy from the outset and led to the
July 15, 1971 announcement. It is in this
spirit that I go to Peking.
EUROPE AND THE ATLANTIC ALLIANCE
"As Britain goes into Europe, there will
be a new Europe. The United States is, at
the present time, embarked on creating
what is really a new America, and we do
live at a time when because of the fast
changing events in the world, we live in a
new world. It is essential that the new
Europe and the new America, together
with the other nations in the world . . .
work together."
Remarks following Meetings with
Prime Minister Heath in Bermuda
December 21, 1971
In 1971, several of the fundamental
goals of United States policy in Europe
came measurably closer.
-The unification of Western Europe
made a major advance, as the deci-
sive steps were taken last year toward
the membership of Britain, Ireland,
Denmark, and Norway in the Eu-
ropean Community.
-The major Atlantic nations and
Japan reached agreement in Decem-
ber on a realignment of exchange
rates. This laid the ground for new
international monetary arrange-
ments reflecting a more balanced
long term relationship between the
U.S. and its economically strong
partners.
-Our allies strengthened their force
contribution to the common defense
and took up a greater share of the
collective burden.
--The Four Powers reached an agree-
ment on Berlin, designed to end the
perennial postwar crises over the city
and to improve the situation of the
brave people of West Berlin in con-
crete ways.
-The prospect arose, for the first time,
of concrete discussions with the East
on other unresolved issues of security
and cooperation in all of Europe.
-The new, more mature political re-
lationship between the United States
and its partners was symbolized by
my unprecedented series of summit
meetings with Alliance leaders at the
end of the year.
The flourishing of the Atlantic world,
the security of the Atlantic Alliance, and
the relaxation of East-West tension have
been the broad purposes of United States
policy in Europe for 27 years. I came into
office at an historical turning point, when
new conditions emerging in Europe of-
fered unique opportunities for progress
toward these goals. In three years, much
of this promise has been fulfilled. The
