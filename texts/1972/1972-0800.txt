233 Letter About the Death of the Metropolitan Opera's
General Manager, Goeran Gentele. July 19, 1972
Dear George:
The untimely and tragic death of
Goeran Gentele came as a shock to me
personally and to countless fellow
Americans.
His tenure at the Metropolitan Opera
Association revealed an able man who
had a clear perception of his enormous
responsibilities to maintain the Metro-
politan Opera's prestigious role as a great
international opera house, and one who
possessed the vision to set new patterns
for opera programming in the near future.
Mrs. Gentele and her daughter are in
our thoughts and prayers at this difficult
time, and Mrs. Nixon and I hope that you
will convey to them our deepest sympathy
as well as our heartfelt wishes for their
recovery.
Sincerely,
RICHARD NIXON
[Mr. George S. Moore, Chairman of the Board,
Metropolitan Opera Association, Lincoln Cen-
ter Plaza, New York, New York 10023]
NOTE: Mr. Gentele, 54, died in an automobile
accident on July 18, 1972, while vacationing
on the Italian island of Sardinia in the Medi-
terranean. His daughters, Anne and Beatrice,
were killed, and Mrs. Gentele and her daughter
Janette were injured in the accident.
Mr. Gentele was director of the Royal Opera
House in Stockholm, Sweden, from 1963
through 1971. His appointment as general man-
ager of the Metropolitan Opera for the 1972-
73 season was announced in 1970, but he offi-
cially assumed the position July 1972.
The text of the letter was made available
