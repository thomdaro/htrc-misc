Public Papers of the Presidents
berra, Australia on August 8, 1969,
noted the barriers between our coun-
tries but added, "We nonetheless look
forward to a time when we can enter
into a useful dialogue and to a reduc-
tion of tensions."
--In my February 1970 Foreign Policy
Report, I stated that ". . . it is cer-
tainly in our interest, and in the
interest of peace and stability in Asia
and the world, that we take what
steps we can toward improved prac-
tical relations with Peking. . . . we
will seek to promote understandings
which can establish a new pattern of
mutually beneficial actions."
-On October 26, 1970, in a toast to
visiting President Ceausescu
Romania, I deliberately used Peking's
official title, "the People's Republic of
China". This was the first time an
American President had ever done
So.

By the time of my second Foreign Pol-
icy Report in February 1971, we had rea-
son to believe that our moves were being
noted and evaluated by the Chinese. In
that Report, I cited the importance of
China's participation in world affairs,
reiterated that we were ready for a dia-
logue with Peking, and stated that we
hoped to see the People's Republic of
China assume a constructive role in the
family of nations. I looked toward the
immediate future:
"In the coming year, I will carefully
examine what further steps we might take
to create broader opportunities for con-
tacts between the Chinese and American
peoples, and how we might remove need-
less obstacles to the realization of these
opportunities. We hope for, but will not
be deterred by a lack of, reciprocity."
THE BREAKTHROUGH
By the fall of 1970, in private and re-
liable diplomatic channels, the Chinese
began to respond. Both sides were now
working to launch a process. The spring
of 1971 saw a series of orchestrated public
and private steps which culminated in Dr.
Kissinger's July trip to Peking and the
agreement for me to meet with the leaders
of the People's Republic of China.
-On March 15, 1971 we announced
that U.S. passports no longer needed
special validation for travel to main-
land China.
-On April 6, 1971, in Nagoya, Japan,
the U.S. table tennis team competing
in the world championships received
an invitation from the Chinese team
to visit mainland China. This was
accepted the next day. The Chinese
also granted visas to seven Western
newsmen to cover the team's tour.
The U.S. team traveled extensively
in China, and was received on
April 14 by Prime Minister Chou
En-lai, who told them: "with your
acceptance of our invitation, you
have opened a new page in the rela-
tions of the Chinese and American
people."
-On that same day, we moved to
further the momentum that had
clearly developed. I decided on the
following measures which had been
under governmental study since De-
cember 1970:
• We would expedite visas for visitors
from the PRC;
• U.S. currency controls would be
relaxed to permit the PRC to use
dollars;
·
Restrictions on U.S. oil companies
