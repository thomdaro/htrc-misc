Richard Nixon, 1972
Feb. 8 [51]
Preservation of historic buildings
Power plant siting
Regulation of environmental effects of
surface and underground mining
Ocean dumping regulation
More effective control of water pollu-
tion through a greatly expanded
waste treatment grant program and
strengthened standard-setting and
enforcement authorities
A National Land Use Policy Act
Substantial expansion of the wilderness
system
Expanded international cooperation
To date, most of the legislation on this
list has been the subject of congressional
hearings; most of it has attracted hearten-
ing interest and support; but none of it has
yet received final congressional action.
Last year was, quite properly, a year of
consideration of these measures by the
Congress. I urge, however, that this be a
year of action on all of them, so that we
can move on from intention to accom-
plishment in the important needs they
address. Passage of these measures and
creation of the unified Department of
Natural Resources which I also proposed
in 1971-by this 92nd Congress-will be
essential if we are to have an adequate
base for improving environmental quality.
BUILDING ON THE BASE
As that base is being established, we
must move ahead to build wisely and
rapidly upon it. I shall outline today a
plan for doing that, with initiatives and
actions in the following areas:
-Tightening pollution control
A Toxic Wastes Disposal Control
Act
Legislation to control sediment
from construction activities
An emissions charge to reduce sul-
fur oxide air pollution
Clean energy research and energy
conservation measures
-Making technology an environmental
ally
Integrated pest management
Stepped-up research on
control
noise
Stepped-up research on air pollu-
tion effects and measurement
-Improving land use
Expansion and strengthening of
the National Land Use Policy
Act
Protection of wetlands
-Protecting our natural heritage
A ban on use of poisons for preda-
tor control on public lands
A stronger law to protect endan-
gered species of wildlife
Big Cypress National Fresh Water
Reserve
National Recreation Areas around
New York Harbor and the Gold-
en Gate
Conversion of 20 additional Fed-
eral properties to recreational
use
18 new Wilderness Areas
Regulation of off-road vehicles on
Federal lands
-Expanding international cooperation
on the environment
Establishment of a United Nations
Fund for the Environment
Further measures to control marine
pollution
-Protecting children from lead-based
paint
