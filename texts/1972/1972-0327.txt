Richard Nixon, 1972
Feb. 9 [56]
How we dealt with this issue would be
crucial to our efforts to shape a new role
for America in the 1970's and beyond.
Obviously we wanted to end the war. But
we knew that the way we ended the war,
or our involvement in it, would funda-
mentally affect our broader international
effort.
There were no easy choices. Further
escalation of our military efforts would
deepen the divisions in our society, could
not assure success in a conflict which was
as much political as military, and could
risk a wider war.
Continuing on the same path offered
no clear prospect either of ending Ameri-
can involvement or of ending the war.
Such a course could not have commanded
American domestic support.
Precipitate disengagement, without
regard to consequences, would have made
impossible our efforts to forge a new for-
eign policy. It might have been domes-
tically popular for a short term, but as its
consequences became clear, the
agony of
recrimination would have replaced the
agony of war. Overseas, this course would
have shaken the trust of our friends and
earned the contempt of our adversaries.
We could not begin to build new partner-
ships by turning our back on people who
had come to count on our support. And
we could not set out to negotiate with ad-
versaries by abandoning allies.
There were, however, two possible
courses of action that would be inter-
nationally responsible and responsive to
domestic opinion. The fastest and most
decisive course was to negotiate a settle-
ment to end the war for all participants.
We progressively defined the terms of a
settlement publicly and privately to Hanoi.
This effort culminated in the comprehen-
sive U.S.-South Vietnamese proposal
which I made public on January 25, 1972.
However, we could not afford to rely
solely on North Vietnamese willingness to
reach a settlement. We needed an alter-
native. Thus we launched the process of
progressively turning over defense respon-
sibilities to the South Vietnamese and
thereby reducing U.S. involvement. We
also hoped this course would stimulate
negotiation.
Progress in Vietnamization
We have come a long way.
-There has been a steady decline in
American forces over the past three
years, with over 400,000 of our troops
withdrawn. The authorized Ameri-
can troop level on February 1, 1972
was 139,000. On January 13, 1972 I
announced a further withdrawal
which by May 1, 1972 will bring our
forces down to 69,000, or an 87 per-
cent reduction from the authorized
level this Administration inherited.
-American combat deaths averaged
278 per week in 1968. In 1971, they
were down to an average of 26, and
in the last six months of 1971 were 11
per week. Close to 60 percent of all
U.S. casualties during this Adminis-
tration occurred in 1969, including
40 percent during the first six
months-before our programs had a
chance to take hold. Despite its vastly
greater role in the war, South Viet-
nam's casualties have also dropped
from the 1968 level.
-In 1971 Americans flew a monthly
average of 11,000 attack sorties in
Indochina, including only 1,500 in
South Vietnam, representing declines
of about 70 percent and 90 percent
respectively of the comparable 1968
figures.
