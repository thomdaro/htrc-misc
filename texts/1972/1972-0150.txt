Public Papers of the Presidents
would provide assistance to State and local
governments for six broad purposes, with
discretion in the use of these funds to be
left primarily to State and local govern-
ments. The following table shows the cate-
gories proposed and the first full year
budget authority that would be provided
for each one:

In total, these revenue sharing pro-
posals would provide $172 billion to
State and local government in their first
full year of operation. The magnitude of
the fiscal crisis and the inefficiency and
unresponsiveness of the present grant sys-
tem make favorable action during this
session of Congress an urgent need. We
can ill-afford further delay.
REORGANIZATION OF THE EXECUTIVE
BRANCH. In my 1971 State of the Union
message, I proposed reform of the execu-
tive branch by regrouping functions now
scattered among seven cabinet depart-
ments and several independent agencies
into four new departments organized
around the major domestic purposes of
government: Community development,
natural resources, human resources, and
economic affairs.
In
my message on departmental reor-
ganization, which I transmitted to the
Congress on March 25, 1971, I described
in detail the need for a comprehensive
restructuring of the domestic executive
departments to equip them to serve our
Nation in the last third of this century.
I cited the fragmentation of Federal re-
sponsibility for education matters, for
manpower programs, for the development
and conservation of water resources, for
the management of public lands, and for
assisting communities in meeting their
needs for water and sewer services.
Typically, three or four separate de-
partments or agencies are now engaged
in administering overlapping or conflict-
ing programs concerned with a single
government objective. This dispersion
and duplication of related functions has
increased the costs of administration, gen-
erated interagency conflict and rivalry,
weakened the departmental secretary as
a leader in program development and
execution, and imposed inexcusable incon-
venience on the public being served. The
excessive number of departments and
agencies independently pursuing related
goals has also frustrated able officials at
all levels, impeded the decentralization of
Federal operations, and made the coor-
dination of administration in the field
inordinately difficult.
By pulling together under each secre-
tary the bulk of the programs which con-
tribute to the achievement of a stated
departmental mission, we can assure the
prompt decisionmaking, the improvement
of procedures, and the integration of
Federal activities which we need for effec-
tive government.
Legislation and detailed plans for the
reorganization have been transmitted to
the Congress. I urge the early enactment
of these basic proposals. They are vital
elements of my strategy to narrow the
gap between what the Federal Govern-
ment promises and what it delivers.
