Foreword
factors that can change even the most carefully charted course
do not lend themselves to easy portrayal on paper.
Yet by reviewing the materials assembled here, readers should
be able to sense both the broad strokes and the fine shadings which
shaped our national policies in 1972. And in the laws, treaties,
and executive actions that grew out of these events, we can see
the tangible effects of these sometimes intangible forces.
Each document in this volume, long or short, marks an aspira-
tion conceived, achieved or frustrated. And if, as the Athenian
historian Thucydides maintained, history is philosophy taught
by example, then each document is also part of a lesson as useful
to posterity as it was instructive to those who lived it.
Every generation views history through lenses of its own making.
The same picture constantly alters in hue and perspective and the
relative importance of its individual parts forever fluctuates. Some-
times the result is greater clarity. At other times it is only fresh
distortion. But in all cases, a full written transcript of the past
can serve as a steadying focal point, a beacon pointing the way
to sound interpretation and reevaluation.
The stronger the beacon-and the physical bulk of this volume
attests to its strength in the case of 1972-the clearer the illumina-
tion it can throw on what is past and the brighter the light it can
cast toward future horizons.
