which by any reasonable standard already
seems sufficient. It is therefore inevitable
that we ask whether the Soviet Union
seeks the numbers and types of forces
needed to attack and destroy vital ele-
ments of our own strategic forces.
The following table illustrates the rela-
tive growth of operational Soviet strategic
missile forces.

We cannot know the intentions of the
Soviet leadership, but we must assume
that this trend reflects a calculated policy
within the framework of an overall stra-
tegic rationale. While it seems unlikely
that the Soviet Union would actually plan
to use these forces in an all-out manner,
their existence is a disturbing reality which
has compelled me to request the funding
of additional offsetting measures.
Our forces are currently sufficient, but
we have acted with great restraint. The
number of missile launchers in the U.S.
strategic force has not changed for five
years. We have improved the retaliatory
capability of each missile with added war-
heads, but we have not provided our
missiles with the combined numbers, ac-
curacy and warhead yield necessary to
threaten Soviet forces with a disarming
strike. The Soviets have the technical
capability to develop similarly sophisti-
cated systems but with greater warhead
yields and consequently greater capability
for a disarming strike.
We are approaching a crucial turning
point in our strategic arms programs. If
the Soviet Union continues to expand
strategic forces, compensating U.S. pro-
grams will be mandatory. The preferable
alternative would be a combination of
mutual restraint and an agreement in
SALT. But under no circumstances will
I permit the further erosion of the stra-
tegic balance with the USSR. I am confi-
dent that the Congress shares these
sentiments.
THE FORCES FOR SUFFICIENCY
As Soviet strategic forces have de-
veloped over the past three years, we have
taken actions to preserve the sufficiency
of our forces. The primary objective of
these improvements has been to decrease
the potential vulnerability of our deterrent
forces. Given the size and sophistication
of Soviet weapons, arguments based on
arithmetical computations that our de-
structive capability is excessive are sim-
plistic. We must retain the capability to
deter or to retaliate if necessary, even if
one element or substantial portions of our
mix of bombers, land-based ICBMs, and
submarine-launched missiles become vul-
nerable. At the same time we have exer-
cised restraint consistent with stability and
the discussions in SALT.
Thus, in light of growing Soviet stra-
tegic capabilities, we have taken certain
measured steps to strengthen our defensive
position by improving the prospects for
survival of our forces.
-We have continued to increase the
hardness of our Minuteman ICBM
silos, making them less vulnerable to
attack. This contributes to stability
by decreasing the prospect of a suc-
cessful disarming attack by a poten-
tial aggressor.
