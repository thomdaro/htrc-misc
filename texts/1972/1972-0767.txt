Richard Nixon, 1972
June 29 [214]
We have made significant progress
in
our battle against rising prices. We are
going to do whatever is necessary to see
that that battle is won.
Earlier this year, we announced an im-
port program to increase meat imports 11
percent over meat imports during 1971.ยน
Since that time, however, the continuing
shift in demand and supplies has become

much more pronounced.
All meat imports, of course, will be
subject to the same high standards of
sanitation that apply to domestically pro-
duced meat.
This action is not aimed at the Ameri-
can farmer; his income has only begun to
approach reasonable levels. It is intended
to remedy a short-term shortage which is
beyond the ability of our farmers to fill.
Letter to the Secretary of Agriculture About
Suspension of Restrictions on Meat Imports.
June 26, 1972
Dear Mr. Secretary:
I have taken action today to liberalize
the imports of beef. The action is being
taken to help us meet the exploding de-
mand for beef in this country.
As I have discussed with you, I am
satisfied that in taking this action we are
not endangering the economic position
of our livestock producers.
Over the years they have made a sus-
tained and essential contribution to meet-
ing our growing demand for beef. I recog-
nize fully that their continued economic
health is essential so that they can play
their full part in meeting our future de-
mands. I know you are confident that they
will continue to make this contribution
and that you will call on me for any
assistance you may need.
Sincerely,
RICHARD NIXON
[Honorable Earl L. Butz, Secretary of Agricul-
ture, Washington, D.C.]

214 The President's News Conference of
June 29, 1972
QUESTIONS
THE PRESIDENT. [1.] Mr. Cormier
[Frank Cormier, Associated Press] has the
first question tonight.
Q. Mr. President, I don't want to ask
a soft or flabby question because, as you
know, your associate John Ehrlichman
has suggested that news conferences really
are not all that important because we tend
to ask that type of question too often.
So I want to submit one for the Ehr-
lichman Award this evening.
THE PRESIDENT. As long as it is not
soft and flabby.
