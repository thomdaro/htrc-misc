Appendix E
ment, he indicated that he would serve for a
period of only a year and that the time is up
now. So the President has accepted with deep
appreciation for his contribution to the Ad-
ministration and to the country his resigna-
tion as a member of the Price Commission.
Finally, we have another announcement this
morning with regard to a nomination which
the President will make to the Senate early
next year. This announcement regards an in-
dividual whose position does not make him
a member of the President's Administration,
strictly speaking, but which certainly makes
him an important colleague and partner of
the Administration.
I am referring to Mayor Walter E. Wash-
ington, the Mayor-Commissioner of the District
of Columbia. The President is pleased to an-
nounce his intention to nominate Mayor Walter
Washington to continue serving in his present
post as the top official in the city of Washing-
ton for another 4-year term after his present
term expires in February of 1973.
Walter Washington is the only man ever to
have filled the post of Mayor-Commissioner,
having been named to the job by President
Johnson at the time it was created in 1967,
and reappointed to a 4-year term by President
Nixon in 1969. We will have, as I said, a com-
plete biography on Mayor Walter Washington
for you after the briefing.
