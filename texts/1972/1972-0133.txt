rhetoric because it calls to account the
open-ended promises heard so often in an
election year. Proposals, no matter how
attractive, must be paid for, and when
spending is proposed that takes us beyond
full employment balance, that payment
must either be in the form of new taxes
or rising prices. As the budget submitted
herewith proves, I intend to resist the
kind of spending that drives up taxes or
drives up prices.
One priority that most Americans will
agree upon is the return of power to
people, after decades of the flow of power
to Washington. One good way of turning
rhetoric into reality is to put that prin-
ciple into practice in the tax area.
Power in its most specific sense is spend-
ing power. My own choice between
Government spending and individual
spending has been clear and consistent:
I believe some of that power should be
taken from the Federal Government and
returned to the individual.
Accordingly, over the past 3 years, the
rate of increase in Government spending
has been cut nearly in half compared to
the 3 comparable years before this Admin-
istration took office.
From 1965 to 1968, Federal spending
increased by 51%-an annual average of
17%; over the 3-year period 1969-72,
spending rose by 28%-an average of
9% per year. The increase from 1972 to
the spending level proposed in this budget
is only 4.1%. This slash in the momentum
of Federal spending is all the more
dramatic when you consider that 71% of
Federal spending is "uncontrollable❞—
that is, locked into the budget by previous
congressional decisions.
By putting the brakes on the increase
in Government spending, we have been
able to leave more spending power in the
hands of the individual taxpayer. In 1973,
individuals will pay $22 billion less in
Federal income taxes than they would if
the tax rates and structure were the same
as those in existence when I took office.
To a family of four that earns $7,500 a
year, that means a reduction of Federal
income taxes of $272 this calendar year.
I believe that the members of that family
can use that money more productively for
their own needs than Government can use
it for them.
The basic shift in the Government's fis-
cal philosophy has gone relatively unno-
ticed. The upward curve of Federal
spending is beginning to flatten out, while
the Federal income tax "bite" out of the
individual paycheck is becoming measur-
ably less. This change in direction is as
remarkable as it has been unremarked.
We are not only talking about returning
power-economic power, real power-to
people and localities, we are doing some-
thing about it.
Throughout this budget, a clear trend
can be seen that is designed to return
