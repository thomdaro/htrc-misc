tion or development of new technical
advances.
I am also initiating new programs and
strengthening research and development
aimed at three important objectives:
-protecting man and nature from each
other;
-using the resources of nature to serve
mankind's needs; and
-pioneering new and improved
human services.
The overall result of our efforts to
strengthen science and technology in the
national interest is reflected in the 1973
increase of $1.4 billion in obligations to a
total of $17.8 billion. I firmly believe this
large increase is vital to the security, wel-
fare, and economic well-being of our
country.
IMPROVING GOVERNMENT
Improved efficiency and responsiveness
at all levels of government is a major ob-
jective of this Administration. One of my
first acts as President was to direct that an
intensive review be made of our Federal
system of government. We found that the
executive branch was badly organized to
accomplish domestic objectives. We found
that State and local governments were
often unable to meet the needs of their
citizens because of a fiscal crisis that was
steadily worsening. And we also found
that Federal programs to assist State and
local governments had become a maze of
separate programs, understood only by
members of a new profession-grantsman-
ship specialists.
The Administration has developed a
comprehensive strategy for dealing with
these problems. This strategy includes:
•
Revenue sharing-an important ele-
ment of the strategy-to provide
•
fiscal relief and to strengthen State
and local governments;
Reorganization of the executive
branch to create four new depart-
ments structured around the basic
domestic activities of government;
• Federal Assistance Review (FAR) to
strengthen delivery of Federal assist-
ance to State and local governments;
Regional councils to help in our pro-
gram of returning power to the
people;
Technical assistance to help State
and local governments improve their
organizational structures and man-
agement processes; and
Budget reform to enable the execu-
tive branch and the Congress better
to serve the people.
REVENUE SHARING.-A year ago I pro-
posed to the Congress a General Revenue
Sharing program and six special revenue
sharing programs to relieve the fiscal crisis
of State and local governments and to
eliminate some of the problems of the
present categorical grant system. No ac-
tion has yet been taken on these proposals.
again urge that Congress enact these
proposals.
If enacted to become effective Janu-
ary 1, 1972, as I am proposing, the Gen-
eral Revenue Sharing program would:
-provide $2.5 billion of budget au-
thority in fiscal year 1972 and $5.3
billion in fiscal year 1973 to help re-
lieve the fiscal plight of State and
local governments;
-enable those units of government
closest to the people to determine how
the funds would be spent to meet
local needs and priorities; and
-reduce pressures to raise State and
local taxes.
