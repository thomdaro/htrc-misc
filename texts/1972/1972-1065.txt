ically disabled act raises the standard of
justice and opportunity for handicapped
persons in the District of Columbia.
Sometimes it is difficult to know at
close range whether the city's tribulations
with excavated streets, barricaded con-
struction sites, community disputes, and
the like indicate progress or merely con-
fusion. But a major legislative achieve-
ment like that represented by these six
bills offers heartening proof that the sys-
tem does work and that a better day is
coming for all the people of the National
Capital region. I commend the bipartisan
effort in the Congress, and the construc-
tive cooperation of Federal and local offi-
cials and concerned citizens, which made
this possible and which points to more
progress in the future.

359 Memorandum of Disapproval of the National
Environmental Data System and Environmental
Centers Act of 1972. October 21, 1972
I AM withholding my approval from
H.R. 56.
My objections to this bill are centered
upon two of its titles which would establish
a National Environmental Data System
and create environmental centers in each
State. While both of these titles sound de-
sirable in theory, they would in reality
lead to the duplication of information or
would produce results unrelated to real
needs and wasteful of talent, resources,
and the taxpayers' money.
A third portion of H.R. 56 would direct
the Federal Government to purchase the
Klamath Indian Forest lands in Oregon.
After studying this proposal carefully, I
believe this purchase would be sound
public policy, and if the next Congress
provides the necessary funds, I shall
happily approve the acquisition of these
unique lands.
In the form now before me, Title I of
this legislation calls for the establishment
of an independent, centralized environ-
mental data system for the acquisition,
storage and dissemination of information
relating to the environment. Data for the
system would come from governmental,
international and private sources. A Di-
rector, who would be under the guidance
of the Council on Environmental Quality,
would determine what data would
