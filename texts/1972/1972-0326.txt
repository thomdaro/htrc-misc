"To end this war-but to end it in a
way that will strengthen trust for America
around the world, not undermine it; in a
way that will redeem the sacrifices that
have been made, not insult them; in a way
that will heal this Nation, not tear it
apart."
Address to the Nation
April 7, 1971
The essential international challenge
when this Administration took office was
to shape a new American role in the world,
to share responsibilities in creative part-
nerships with our friends, and to move
from confrontation to negotiation with
our opponents. But as we set out on this
road in January 1969, we faced the hard
realities of a seemingly open ended war in
Indochina.
-Five years of steadily rising American
troop levels in Vietnam had brought
our authorized strength there to
549,500.
-American combat deaths during 1968
had averaged 278 weekly.
-Americans were flying about 33,000
tactical air sorties each month in
Indochina, including 18,500 in South
Vietnam.
-U.S.monthly draft calls in 1968 aver-
aged over 30,000.
-In mid-1969, roughly 40 percent of
South Vietnam's rural population
was under government control, with
50 percent contested and 10 percent
under the control of the other side.
As the enemy's general offensives of
1968 demonstrated, the urban popu-
lation of 6 million was by no means
secure from attack.
-Straining under the burdens of war,
the South Vietnamese economy was
wracked by inflation running at a
rate of 35-40 percent. There was lit-
tle planning to overcome this prob-
lem, let alone to provide for long
range economic development.
-The additional costs of the Vietnam
War to the United States had reached
$22 billion a year.
-There was no comprehensive plan
for lowering American involvement
and no suggestion that American
troop levels could be reduced. Indeed
in September 1968, the then Secre-
tary of Defense stated: "We have not
yet reached the level of 549,500 in
South Vietnam. We intend to con-
tinue to build toward that level. We
have no intention of lowering that
level, either by next June or at any
time in the foreseeable future."
-The expanded Paris peace talks were
just beginning and had settled only
on procedures. There were no nego-
tiating proposals on the conference
table to end the conflict.
-Our domestic fabric was severely
strained by dissent over the conflict,
and increasing numbers of Americans
were pressing for the extreme solu-
tions of escalation or immediate
disengagement.
