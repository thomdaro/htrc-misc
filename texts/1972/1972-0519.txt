an indefinite period rather than for a spec-
ified period of years;
-create a new, coordinated system for
service delivery under this act, so that the
Administration on Aging can help develop
goals for such services, while State and
area agencies create specific plans for
achieving these goals; and
-allow States and localities to use some
of the funds now in the Highway Trust
Fund to finance their mass transit pro-
grams, including special programs to help
the elderly.
The Administration will:
-ensure that Departments and agen-
cies involved in the field of aging identify
the portion of their total resources that
are available for older persons and ensure
that use of these resources is effectively
coordinated all across the Government;
-strengthen the role already played by
local officials of the Social Security Ad-
ministration and other agencies in provid-
ing information about Federal services to
older persons and in receiving their com-
plaints;
-launch this summer a new Project
FIND-a program which will enlist the
services of Government workers at the
grassroots level in an outreach effort to
locate older persons who are not involved
in Federal nutrition programs and who
should be;
-step up efforts to meet the special
transportation needs of older Americans,
giving priority to community requests for
capital grants that aid the elderly from
the Urban Mass Transportation Fund;
-provide more and better housing for
older Americans by issuing new guidelines
for two HUD programs to make them
more readily applicable to the elderly, by
extending the mortgage maturity for the
FHA-insured nursing home program, by
drawing upon research of the Law En-
forcement Assistance Administration to
reduce crime, by encouraging the provi-
sions of more space for senior centers
within housing projects for the elderly,
and by developing training programs in
the management of housing for older
persons.
4. To expand opportunities for older per-
sons to continue their involvement in
the life of our country,
The Congress should:
-appropriate the funds I have re-
quested for such action programs as Re-
tired Senior Volunteers and Foster Grand-
parents;
--authorize the ACTION agency to ex-
pand person-to-person volunteer service
programs, helping more older Americans
to work both with children and with older
persons who need their help; and
-broaden the Age Discrimination in
Employment Act of 1967 to include State
and local governments.
The Administration will:
-work with 130 national voluntary
groups across the country in a special pro-
gram to stimulate volunteer action; and
-develop a national program to ex-
pand employment opportunities for per-
sons over 65, through programs such as
Senior Aides and Green Thumb, by
urging State and local governments to
make job opportunities available under
the Emergency Employment Act of 1971,
by working through the public employ-
ment offices to open part-time job oppor-
tunities in both the public and private sec-
tor, and by reaffirming Federal policy
