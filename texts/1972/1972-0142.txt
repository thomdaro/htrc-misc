Public Papers of the Presidents
Several major proposals in this budget
are responsive to the special needs of the
aged:
-social security and workfare legisla-
tion that will add $5.5 billion to the
income of the elderly when it is fully
in effect and provide an income floor
for older Americans;
-elimination of the monthly premium
for supplementary medical insurance
in Medicare that will save the elderly
$1.5 billion in the first full year;
-$100 million, a fivefold increase over
the amount budgeted last year, for
the Administration on Aging to pro-
vide additional homemaker services,
home health aides, transportation,
and nutrition services to help older
Americans remain in their homes;
-a tripling of the retired senior volun-
teer program, a doubling of the foster
grandparents programs, and a dou-
bling of jobs programs for older
per-
sons with low incomes from the levels
budgeted last year to enable more of
the aged to engage in useful com-
munity projects; and
-tax incentives that will broaden the
coverage of private pension plans.
The Congress has not yet acted on the
major reform in the social security system
that I proposed last year-providing auto-
matic adjustments for increases in the cost
of living. The older Americans who de-
pend on their social security checks have
waited long enough. I urge the Congress
to act promptly on this reform and, in
addition to:
-raise benefits by 5%, effective July 1,
1972, making the cumulative increase
more than one-third in less than 3
years;
-allow recipients to earn more money
from wages without losing their
benefits; and
-increase widows' benefits up to the
level their deceased husbands would
have received.
IMPROVING HEALTH CARE.-Almost a
year ago, I submitted a health message to
the Congress establishing a National
Health Strategy for the 1970's. This strat-
egy was directed toward three objectives:
prevention of health problems, assured
access to medical care, and greater effi-
ciency within the health care system.
To achieve these objectives, I urge the
Congress to act promptly on the pending
National Health Insurance Standards Act,
the proposed Family Health Insurance
Plan, and legislation to support the devel-
opment of health maintenance organiza-
tions.
In addition, in 1973, I propose further
actions that are essential to my national
health strategy, including:
--a substantial increase in funds for the
attacks on cancer and sickle cell
anemia;
-continued financial support to our
health manpower training institutions
and to their students;
-expanded efforts to develop health
maintenance organizations
a
model of improved health care de-
livery;
-significant increases for protecting
consumers from hazardous food and
products;
-expanded community programs to
deal with special health problems,
such as drug addiction and alcohol-
ism;
-improvement of the Medicare pro-
gram by eliminating the monthly
premium for physician services; and
