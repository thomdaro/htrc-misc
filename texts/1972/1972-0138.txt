1 These estimates reflect the fact that under conditions of full employment outlays for unemploy-
ment insurance benefits and the Emergency Employment Act program would be lower. Spending
under other programs are also affected by employment conditions. For example, outlays for food
stamps, social security benefits, public assistance, and veterans' pensions would also be lower under
conditions of full employment, and interest would be higher. If adjustments were feasible for all such
items, full employment outlays probably would be lower.
2 Including loans in expenditure account.

outlay increase will also help provide jobs
and business investment in the year ahead,
while remaining within the limit set by
full-employment budget guidelines. If the
economy were operating at full employ-
ment throughout the year, outlays for un-
employment insurance benefits and the
Emergency Employment Act—and outlay
totals-would be lower than the amounts
included in the 1973 budget.
This budget requests $271 billion of
budget authority-the right to make com-
mitments to spend-in 1973. About $185
billion of this amount will require new
action on the part of the Congress.
STRATEGY FOR PEACE
The highest priority of my Administra-
tion is to bring about an era of peace and
prosperity. We are pursuing this goal
through partnership with our allies, mili
tary strength adequate to deter aggression,
negotiations with those with whom we
differ, and foreign assistance that en-
courages self-sufficiency.
