ers who have exhausted their benefits in
States where unemployment remains high.
Despite dramatic increases in employ-
ment nationally-from 78.8 million jobs
in May 1971 to 81.4 million jobs in May
1972-some areas of stubborn unemploy-
ment continue to persist, largely because
of a continuing shift of expenditures from
defense and defense-related industries to
domestic needs.
I am deeply concerned with the eco-
nomic well-being of all American work-
ers. While the economy is showing encour-
aging signs of growth, the anticipated re-
duction in unemployment is taking more
time in some areas and, therefore, a tem-
porary continuation of emergency unem-
ployment compensation benefits is needed.
When I signed the Emergency Unem-
218 Statement About Signing
and Relief Act of 1972.
I AM pleased to have signed into law
S. 3338, the Veterans' Compensation and
Relief Act of 1972.
At my request the Veterans Adminis-
tration proposed legislation to increase
veterans disability compensation benefits
in order to meet rises in the cost of living,
and I am gratified that the Congress has
responded to my request with this act.
I would also like to express my appre-
ciation to the Congress for their coopera-
tion with my efforts to have this act de-
livered to me so that I can sign it into law
before midnight tonight [June 30]. As a
result, the increased compensation bene-
fits will now be delivered to disabled vet-
erans beginning August 1, 1972, rather
ployment Compensation Act of 1971 last
December, I called attention to the seri-
ous deficiency in the financing of that bill.¹
I pointed out that it was a departure from
the usual principle under which our un-
employment insurance programs have op-
erated since the 1930's.
I am gratified that the Congress, in
responding to my request for extending
this legislation, accepted my suggestions
that it should be properly financed.
I am pleased that we can provide this
extended eligibility to our unemployed
American workers.
NOTE: As enacted, H.R. 15587, approved June
30, 1972, is Public Law 92-329 (86 Stat.
398).

than a month later.
Among other things, this act provides
for a 10-percent increase in the monthly
payment for disabled veterans and a
similar increase in allowances for those
more seriously disabled veterans with
dependents.
This is the second opportunity I have
had during my Administration to sign
into effect an increase in disabled veterans
compensation benefits. I am pleased that
these benefit increases will soon be helping
over 2 million of our most deserving men
and women.
