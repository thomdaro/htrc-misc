peace in the world. We are all dedicated
to that, Republicans, Democrats, without
regard to party.
We have made great progress in that
direction, particularly in the last year
as we have moved, as you know, in new
initiatives toward those who might have
been potential enemies of the United
States.
every
No one can be sure what will happen
in the future. But I want to make this
pledge to you. You can be sure that
hour that I can possibly devote to this
cause will be devoted to it because I feel
a deep sense of personal gratitude to the
men and women that have served this
country, to those that have sacrificed so
much.
I can no longer serve. I think I am
physically fit, but they say I am too old.
But I can serve along with the Members
of the House and Senate that are here,
Democrats and Republicans, in another
way, and that is to work unceasingly to-
ward the goal that we have not had in this
century in America: a generation with-
out war for all Americans, a world at
peace. This is our goal. This is what you
have fought for, and we trust that we will
be able to achieve that goal for which
you have sacrificed so much.
Thank you.
I shall now sign the bills. As you will
note, I am using the traditional Presi-
dential signing pen. When we sign bills
we give souvenir pens to the Members of
the House and Senate, of which there are
several present here today, who have been
supporting this legislation. We also have
extra pens for all of those attending the
ceremony. I trust that you can endorse the
first check with that increased benefit with
it!

371 Statement About Veterans Benefits Legislation.
October 24, 1972
THIS Nation has a profound commit-
ment to our 29 million veterans, and I
pledge that we shall serve them as well as
they have served us.
Today I am especially pleased to sign
into law two measures which will advance
us a long way toward that goal:
-H.R. 12828, the Vietnam Era Vet-
erans' Readjustment Assistance Act of
1972, and
-H.J. Res. 748, the Veterans' Admin-
istration Medical School Assistance and
Health Manpower Training Act of 1972.
Our commitment to veterans was well
demonstrated on March 26, 1970, when
I signed Public Law 91-219, which sub-
stantially increased monthly GI bill edu-
cational allowances-raising those for a
single veteran with no dependents from
$130 to $175.
Today, with the signing of H.R. 12828,
the $175 monthly figure is increased to a
new alltime high of $220.
This important measure actually in-
