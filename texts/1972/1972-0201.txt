40 Special Message to the Congress Outlining Plans for the
Bicentennial Observance in the District of Columbia.
February 4, 1972
To the Congress of the United States:
"Seafaring is necessary," says the Latin
inscription on an old building in one of the
great European port cities; "mere living
is not." This same spirit of movement, ven-
ture, and quest animates the whole sweep
of America's story-from its discovery by
men who lived for sailing, to its founding
as a nation by men who lived for liberty,
to its modern maturity as the world's pre-
eminent power-and it will do so still, 4
years hence, when we observe the Bicen-
tennial of American independence. The
Nation could not if it wanted to, and
should not if it could, drop anchor some-
where in 1976 and savor the occasion at
leisure. By its very nature it can only speed
through the year as through any other,
under full sail, on into a new century.
The central challenge of our Bicenten-
nial preparations, therefore, is to plan for
an observance "on the move." Many
groups-public and private, national and
local-have already devoted several years
of creative thought and effort to meeting
this challenge. The common goal to which
all subscribe has nowhere been stated bet-
ter than in the 1970 report of the celebra-
tion's official planning and coordinating
body, the American Revolution Bicen-
tennial Commission (ARBC): "to forge
a new national commitmentâ€”a new Spirit
for '76-a commitment which will unite
the nation in purpose and dedication to
the advancement of human welfare as we
move into Century III of American Na-
tional Life."
We can best forge such a spirit, the
Commission went on to recommend, by
approaching the Bicentennial as an occa-
sion both for understanding our heritage
better and for quickening the progress
toward our horizons-not just in one
chosen location or a few, but in every
State, city, and community. The Commis-
sion's goal and the principles deriving
from it have my strongest support, and I
have followed with interest the ARBC's
further work as well as that of the in-
dividual Bicentennial Commissions al-
ready set up or now being formed by each
State and territory, Puerto Rico, and the
District of Columbia,
THE BICENTENNIAL IN WASHINGTON
Since the Federal Government has spe-
cial responsibility for District of Columbia
affairs, my closest contact has been with
the planning effort now underway here
in the District and I have found its prog-
ress thus far most impressive. And so it
should be. For while no one city will domi-
nate this truly national anniversary,
Washington-which was built to be the
Capital of the Republic born in 1776 and
seat of the Government constituted in
1787, and which has been in many ways a
center of the hopes of all Americans in all
generations since has a unique role to
