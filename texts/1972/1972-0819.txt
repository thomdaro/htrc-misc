242 Message to the Congress Transmitting Annual Report on
Comparability of Federal and Private Enterprise
Salaries. August 1, 1972
To the Congress of the United States:
I am forwarding herewith the annual
comparison of Federal salaries in the
statutory pay systems to the salaries paid
in private enterprise, as required by sec-
tion 5305 of title 5, United States Code.
The report, prepared by the Director
of the Office of Management and Budget
and the Chairman of the Civil Service
Commission, compares the General
Schedule pay rates to the rates paid in
private enterprise for the same levels of
work, as published in the Bureau of Labor
Statistics Bulletin No. 1742, National
Survey of Professional, Administrative,
Technical and Clerical Pay, June 1971.
No adjustment based upon the com-
parison was made in Federal pay rates
because of the substitute measure enacted
as a part of the Economic Stabilization
Act Amendments of 1971 (Public Law
92-210, approved December 22, 1971).
In addition, the Advisory Committee
on Federal Pay reviewed the report and
its comments are enclosed.
The White House,
August 1, 1972.
RICHARD NIXON
NOTE: The report (3 pp. plus appendixes) is
printed in House Document 92â€“332.
243 Message to the Congress Transmitting a Proposed
Amendment to the Disaster Recovery Bill.
August 2, 1972
To the Congress of the United States:
Tropical Storm Agnes caused the most
widespread destruction and devastation
of any natural disaster in the history of
the United States. On July 17, 1972, I
sent to the Congress a proposal authoriz-
ing special disaster recovery measures
which would aid victims of Agnes and also
of the flood in Rapid City, South Dakota
during June 1972.
As I stated in my transmittal message,
the need for prompt enactment of these
aid proposals, aimed at short and long-
term recovery, is extreme and urgent. I
asked the Congress then to consider and
enact them within seven days. Sixteen
