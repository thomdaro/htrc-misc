Public Papers of the Presidents
55 Message to the Congress Transmitting Third Annual
Report on United States Foreign Policy.
February 9, 1972
To the Congress of the United States:
As I prepare to set out on my summit
trips to Peking and Moscow, it is especially
timely for the American people and the
Congress to have available a basis for
understanding the Government's policies
and broad purposes in foreign affairs.
That is the function of this, my third an-
nual report.
These annual reports trace the evolu-
tion of our policies over the years of our
term of office and describe our responses
to new problems and issues as they have
arisen. They provide an insight into our
56
philosophy of foreign policy and our new
approaches to peace.
The broad framework presented here
will be filled out in two other major docu-
ments: the Secretary of State's second
annual report, which will describe in de-
tail our relations with individual coun-
tries and set forth the major public docu-
mentation of our policy, and the annual
Defense Report of the Secretary of
Defense.
The White House,
February 9, 1972.
