Richard Nixon, 1972
Jan. 24 [19]
We seek peace to reduce the human suf-
fering that is an inevitable part of war.
With peace we can release energies and
resources that can be used to improve the
quality of life everywhere. We have ac-
complished much of this high purpose
during the past 3 years—particularly as a
result of the Vietnamization program.

South Vietnamese forces have as-
sumed the responsibility for ground
combat operations. Vietnamization is
moving forward in other areas as well.
As a result:
-U.S. casualties due to hostilities
have been averaging less than 10
per week, as compared with 300 per
week in 1968;
-the authorized troop level in South
Vietnam will have been reduced
from 549,500 in January 1969 to
69,000 as of May 1, 1972; and
-draft calls have been reduced from
a Vietnam war high of 382,000 to
94,000 in calendar year 1971, as we
move toward the goal of zero draft
calls.
Negotiations with the Soviet Union
on strategic arms limitations are
progressing.
Agreement has been reached with
NATO members on a 5-year plan to
strengthen their defenses, with a sub-
stantial increase in their financial con-
tribution.
Security assistance programs are be-
ing planned with a view toward bet-
ter coordinating them with our over-
all security effort. In some cases, this
may permit additional reductions in
U.S. manpower needs overseas.
Our efforts toward peace have not
been-and will not be-at the expense
our military strength. Indeed, measures to
maintain that strength are a vital part of
of
our peace efforts. Accordingly, this budget
proposes a substantial increase in de-
fense programs to provide for the follow-
ing improvements:
-additional resources for our strategic
forces to increase emphasis on our
sea-based strategic deterrent force
and to continue modernization of
present offensive and
offensive and defensive
forces;
—a major increase in shipbuilding, re-
flecting the high priority I place upon
modernizing our naval forces;
-a sizable increase in research and de-
velopment to assure continuation of
our technological superiority;
-newer equipment, higher manning
levels, and further training to im-
prove the ability of the National
Guard and Reserves to supplement
the Active Forces;
-continued development and procure-
ment of more effective weapons sys-
tems for the land and tactical air
forces; and
-a major effort to achieve an all-
volunteer force. Toward this end, a
career in the Armed Forces was made
more attractive by doubling the basic
pay of first time enlistees in Novem-
ber
1971. Other increases in military
pay are budgeted for January 1972
and 1973.
Strong foreign assistance programs are
also an essential part of our strategy for
peace, serving to:
-implement the Nixon Doctrine by
helping foreign nations assume
greater share of the responsibility for
their defense;
-strengthen the economies of develop-
ing nations; and
-provide humanitarian assistance and
relief.
