OTHER ENVIRONMENTAL ACTIONS
Another significant environmental bill
which I am signing into law is S. 2454,
which will extend authority for the Youth
Conservation Corps. This program was
set up on a temporary basis in 1970 to
provide summer employment for young
men and women in our national parks,
forests, and other Federal lands and wa-
ters. S. 2454 will also establish a new
pilot program of Federal grants to help
the States set up similar projects.
I am also pleased to sign H.R. 10384,
which will remove certain restrictions on
the acquisition of lands for recreational
development and on the protection of
natural resources in fish and wildlife
areas. Other notable forward steps will
result from H.R. 11091, increasing the
Federal aid to wildlife restoration fund by
extending existing firearms taxes to cover
archery equipment used in hunting;
H.R. 12186, substantially increasing the
penalties for violations of the Bald Eagle
Protection Act; and H.R. 15280, doubling
the spending authorization for the Na-
tional Advisory Committee on Oceans
and Atmosphere from $200,000 to
$400,000.
Among the other bills which will help
protect our environmental resources for
the enjoyment of all Americans are: S.
27, establishing Glen Canyon National
Recreation Area in Arizona and Utah;
S. 141, establishing Fossil Butte National
Monument in Wyoming; S. 493, classify-
ing the Eagle Cap Area in Oregon as a
wilderness area; S. 1198, authorizing re-
view of the Indian Peaks Area in Colorado
as to its suitability for preservation as
wilderness; S. 1928, designating a seg-
ment of the Saint Croix River in Min-
nesota and Wisconsin as a component of
the national wild and scenic rivers system;
S.
1973, establishing the Thaddeus
Kosciuszko Home National Historic Site
in Pennsylvania; S. 2411, establishing the
Cumberland Island National Seashore in
Georgia; S. 3959, authorizing feasibility
investigations for nine potential water re-
source development projects; S. 4022, au-
thorizing the President to provide for
United States participation in the Inter-
national Exposition on the Environment
in Spokane, Washington, in 1974; H.R.
8756, establishing the Hohokam Pima
National Monument in Arizona; H.R.
13067, providing for the administration
of the Mar-A-Lago National Historic Site
in Florida; H.R. 13396, increasing land
acquisition funds for the Delaware Water
Gap National Recreation Area; and H.R.
15597, increasing land acquisition funds
for Piscataway Park in Maryland.
PROTECTING FOREIGN OFFICIALS IN THE
UNITED STATES
The menace of international terrorism
has become particularly vivid in recent
months--and our Government has been
playing a leading role in the international
effort to combat it. It is with particular
satisfaction, therefore, that I sign H.R.
15883, a bill which makes it a Federal
offense for anyone to harass, assault, kid-
nap, or murder a foreign official, a mem-
ber of his family, or an official guest of
the United States while that person is in
our country. This law will strengthen sig-
nificantly the protection we can provide
for such persons. And it will also
strengthen our position as we work
within the United Nations and the Inter-
national Civil Aviation Organization for
further actions to fight the scourge of
terrorism.
