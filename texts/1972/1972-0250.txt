come for other nations to share a greater
portion of the burden of world leadership;
and its corollary that the assured conti-
nuity of our long term involvement re-
quired a responsible, but more restrained
American role.
THE PHILOSOPHY OF A NEW AMERICAN
FOREIGN POLICY
The earlier Reports also set forth the
philosophical convictions upon which this
Administration was proceeding to reshape
American policies to the requirements of
the new realities. The core principles of
this philosophy are:
-A leading American role in world
affairs continues to be indispensable
to the kind of world our own well-
being requires.
-The end of the bipolar postwar world
opens to this generation a unique
opportunity to create a new and last-
ing structure of peace.
-The end of bipolarity requires that
the structure must be built with the
resources and concepts of many na-
tions-for only when nations partici-
pate in creating an international
system do they contribute to its
vitality and accept its validity.
-Our friendships are constant, but the
means by which they are mutually
expressed must be adjusted as world
conditions change. The continuity
and vigor of our alliances require
that our friends assume greater
responsibilities for Our common
endeavors.
Our enmities are not immutable, and
we must be prepared realistically to
recognize and deal with their cause.
-This requires mutual self-restraint
and a willingness to accommo-
date conflicting national interests
through negotiation rather than
confrontation.
-Agreements are not, however, an end
in themselves. They have permanent
significance only when they contrib-
ute to a stable structure of peace
which all countries wish to preserve
because all countries share its
benefits.
-The unprecedented advances in
science and technology have created
a new dimension of international life.
The global community faces a series
of urgent problems and opportuni-
ties which transcend all geographic
and ideological borders. It is the dis-
tinguishing characteristic of these
issues that their solution requires
international cooperation on the
broadest scale.
-We must, therefore, be willing to
work with all countries-adversaries
as well as friends-toward a structure
of
peace to which all nations con-
tribute and in which all nations have
a stake.
THE BREAKTHROUGH-ACTIONS WE
HAVE TAKEN
This Report is an accounting of the ap-
plication of that philosophy to American
foreign policy. It is beyond dispute that
we have made signal progress. Taken
together, the initiatives of 1971 constitute
a profound change in America's world
role.
The heart of our new conception of that
role is a more balanced alliance with our
friends and a more creative connection
with our adversaries.
BREAKTHROUGH WITH OUR ADVERSARIES.
Toward our two principal adversaries,
the People's Republic of China and the
Soviet Union, we faced dissimilar prob-
