Public Papers of the Presidents
proof, increase widow, widower and de-
layed retirement benefits, liberalize earn-
ings tests, and establish a floor under the
income of older Americans for the first
time;
-repeal the requirement that partici-
pants in part B of Medicare must pay a
monthly premium which is scheduled to
reach $5.80 this July. This step would
make available to older persons an addi-
tional $1.5 billion-the equivalent of
roughly another 4 percent increase in
social security benefits for persons 65 and
over;
-strengthen the role played by private
pension plans by providing tax deductions
to encourage their expansion, requiring
the vesting of pensions, and protecting the
investments which have been made in
these funds;
-enact revenue sharing proposals de-
signed to provide the opportunity for sig-
nificant property tax relief; and
-enact my proposed consumer protec-
tion legislation which deals with problems
which are especially acute for older
citizens.
The Administration will:
-continue its investigation of alterna-
tive methods for financing public educa-
tion in such a manner as to relieve the
present heavy reliance on property taxes;
-propose major improvements in the
military retirement system, including a
one-time recomputation of retired
pay;
-continue the battle against price infla-
tion, with special emphasis in the health
care field;
-develop a program to foster greater
awareness among older citizens of their
legal rights under the Interstate Land
Sales Full Disclosure Act; and
-develop a program designed to help
each State create consumer education
programs for older citizens.
2. To upgrade the quality of nursing
home care,
The Congress should:
-make it possible for the Federal Gov-
ernment to assume the entire cost of State
inspection of homes receiving payments
under the Medicaid program; and
-approve my request for additional
funds for training nursing home personnel.
The Administration will:
-continue to strengthen and expedite
other portions of my 8-point program for
upgrading nursing homes, including my
commitment to withdraw Federal funds
from those homes that refuse to meet
standards and to make adequate alterna-
tive arrangements for those who are dis-
placed from substandard homes; and
-develop proposals for protecting older
persons in the purchase of nursing home
services.
3. To help older persons live dignified,
independent lives in their own homes
or residences,
The Congress should:
-appropriate the $100 million I re-
quested for the Administration on Aging
in my 1973 budget;
-appropriate an additional $100 mil-
lion for nutritional and related purposes;
-appropriate $57 million for other
programs under the Older Americans Act,
bringing total spending under this act to
$257 million-an eight-fold increase over
fiscal year 1969;
-renew and strengthen the Older
Americans Act, which so many older per-
sons rightly regard as landmark legisla-
tion in the field of aging-extending it for
464
