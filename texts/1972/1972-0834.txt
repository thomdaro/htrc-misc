get unemployment down, and steps in
international finance and trade to lay the
basis for increasing the competitiveness
of the United States in the world
economy.
The August 15 policy consisted of ac-
tions the Government would take. But, as
I said in my speech that night, the key to
success would be in the hands of the
American people.
I asked for public cooperation on the
ground of patriotism-for the sake of
America's economic health. But I also
asked for cooperation on the ground of
intelligent self-interest. Only by acting to-
gether could we get off the inflationary
treadmill which for years had been keep-
ing all of us from enjoying the rising
prosperity the American economy was
capable of producing.
This report by the Council of Economic
Advisers describes what has happened
since the New Economic Policy was
adopted. The performance has been
impressive:
•
The rate of increase in the cost of liv-
ing, which had been cut by one-third
before the freeze, has now been cut
in half.
There are 2.5 million more civilian
jobs than there were one year ago.
• The unemployment rate has declined
from about 6 percent to 52 percent.
• Our economy is growing at a rate of
almost 9 percent a year, the highest
since 1965.
Workers' real weekly spendable earn-
ings have risen 4 percent in the last
year, three times the average rate
from 1960 to 1968.
• We have led the world on the path to
international financial and trade re-
form which will substantially help us
to improve our international competi-
tive position as well as help other
countries strengthen their economies.
I want to emphasize that the success of
the New Economic Policy has been due to
the cooperation of the American people.
This cooperation has taken many
forms:
•
•
Voluntary compliance by workers,
businesses, landlords, consumers and
tenants with the price-wage freeze and
then with Phase II has been remark-
able.
During the period when the Phase II
program was being developed, lead-
ers of business, labor, agriculture, and
State and local governments were
most helpful in consulting with the
Federal officials involved. In the fol-
lowing months, many outstanding
citizens have participated in running
the program.
Productivity output per man-hour
-rose 4.3 percent in the past year,
the biggest year-to-year gain since
early 1966. Such an increase of pro-
ductivity is impossible without the
positive mutual contributions of labor
and management.
The fraction of working time lost from
strikes has been at an exceptionally
low level.
The American people can congratulate
themselves on their performance in the
past year and are increasingly enjoying
the tangible benefits of what they and
their Government have done together.
We still have economic problems to
solve, however, and again the key to suc-
cess lies in the hands of the people. We
must firmly establish a lower rate of in-
flation--both in fact and in the public
expectations which help shape the eco-
