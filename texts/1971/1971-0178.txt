Public Papers of the Presidents
islation I will be proposing. It is particu-
larly important that the rationale sup-
porting the basic departmental structure
will recommend be well understood.
I am in basic agreement with the prin-
ciples of government organization ex-
pressed in these memoranda. They reflect
both the need to organize structures on
the basis of purposes and the desirability
of decentralizing decision-making at the
operating level to the Federal regions and
to States and localities wherever possible.
With these thoughts, I commend the
memoranda to your attention. I believe
that you will find them a useful and in-
formative guide as we prepare for the
task of governmental reorganization
which remains before us.
Sincerely,
RICHARD NIXON

47 Statement About National Crime Prevention Week, 1971.
February 6, 1971
THIS YEAR, National Crime Prevention
Week has a solid ring. Our nationwide
campaign against crime is far from won,
but the tide is beginning to turn.
New laws have given the Department
of Justice better weapons against orga-
nized crime and against the narcotics traf-
fic that is a significant cause of crime. Co-
operation with state and local agencies is
the order of the day. A National Council
on Organized Crime, comprising the
heads of all appropriate Federal depart-
ments and agencies, is directing a major
assault on racketeering. The Council has
given new support to the interdepart-
mental strike forces against organized
crime that have now been established in
most major American cities. All the neces-
sary Federal agencies are working to-
gether in a redoubled drive against il-
legal drugs-at home, at our borders, and
at overseas sources.
In the past decade, Washington, D.C.â€”
although the supposed model city for the
nation--won shameful distinction as a
leader in crime statistics. Today, new leg-
islation and increases in manpower are
fostering the reorganization of the whole
structure of criminal justice in our Na-
tion's Capital. Large increases have been
made in Federal grants to state, city and
county police forces for improvements in
standards, training and methods. The re-
sults of these efforts have begun to show.
A positive decline in the number of seri-
ous crimes has occurred in twenty-three
cities of more than 100,000 population.
And our Nation's Capital also has shown
a significant downward trend in crime.
I applaud the sponsors of National
Crime Prevention Week, and urge all
Americans to respond to the challenges
it offers. For only the widest civic partic-
ipation and support can translate the pub-
