17 Letter to Dr. Henry A. Kissinger on His Decision
To Continue as Assistant to the President for
National Security Affairs.
Dear Henry:
Your decision to resign from the faculty
of Harvard University so that you can
remain as a member of my Administration
is one that I know was very difficult for
you. The intensity of both your devotion
to scholarship and your affection for
Harvard are well known to your friends
and associates. I want you to know that I
greet your decision with deep personal
appreciation.
Frankly, I cannot imagine what the
Government would be like without you.
Your wise counsel and strong support over
the past two years have meant a great

deal to me. During this time, our country
has made great strides toward achieving
that just and lasting peace which has al-
ways been our objective. The Nation's
many accomplishments in the field of for-
eign policy during these past two years
have been due in no small measure to your
energy and to your vision.
I am grateful for what you have done
and I am grateful that you are staying.
Sincerely,
RICHARD NIXON
[Honorable Henry A. Kissinger, The White
House, Washington]
