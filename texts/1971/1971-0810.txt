tion in any program or activity to which
HUD gives financial assistance. Title VIII
of the 1968 Civil Rights Act requires HUD
to investigate complaints of housing dis-
crimination and, where appropriate, to
attempt to resolve such complaints
through persuasion or conciliation. In cal-
endar year 1970, HUD completed proc-
essing of 169 complaints; in 89 of these
cases conciliation was successful. In the
same year, HUD referred 19 of these cases
where conciliation failed to the Depart-
ment of Justice.
Under the terms of Title VIII of the
1968 Civil Rights Act, the Attorney Gen-
eral is empowered to bring suits in Federal
court where he finds that racial discrimi-
nation in housing constitutes a "pattern or
practice," or where housing discrimina-
tion cases raise issues of general public
importance. Since January 1969, the At-
torney General has brought or partici-
pated in 85 such suits against more than
250 defendants in 22 States and the Dis-
trict of Columbia. In addition, the Justice
Department has negotiated out of court
with several hundred other persons and
companies and brought them into volun-
tary compliance.
These cases have involved not only out-
right racial discrimination in the sale or
rental of homes but also such practices as
discriminatory real estate advertising and
exclusion of minorities from multiple list-
ing services. Several of the suits have been
against municipal authorities. Several
others have been against major compa-
nies controlling tens of thousands of dwell-
ing units, and have resulted in orders that
they take dramatic remedial efforts to at-
tract minority families into buildings from
which they have previously been barred or
discouraged.
Not only have these suits directly
opened to nonwhites a great deal of hous-
ing previously available only to whites;
they also have had a significant, wider im-
pact in stimulating others to come into
voluntary compliance with the antidis-
crimination laws. This vigorous enforce-
ment as required by law will continue.
Unlawful racial discrimination in hous-
ing extends beyond the barring of indi-
viduals from particular buildings or
neighborhoods because of race. The courts
have also held that, when its reasons for
doing so are racial, a community may not
rezone in order to exclude a federally
assisted housing development. In such
cases, where changes in land use regu-
lations are made for what turns out to be
a racially discriminatory purpose, the
Attorney General, in appropriate circum-
stances, will also bring legal proceedings.
HOW FEDERAL PROGRAMS OPERATE
In order to understand the way in
which the broad "fair housing" mandates.
translate into specific actions, it is im-
portant to understand what some of the
Federal housing programs are and how
they operate.
HUD provides direct financial assist-
ance in three broad areas:
-Housing for low- and moderate-
income families. This includes the
Home Ownership and Rental Hous-
ing Assistance subsidy programs
("Section 235" and "Section 236‚Äù
housing, respectively), the rent sup-
plement program enacted in 1965,
and assistance to low-rent public
housing.
-Grants for State, areawide, and local
planning.
-Aid for community development ac-
tivities, such as urban renewal and
water and sewer grants.
