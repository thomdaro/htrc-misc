much we are willing to pay and how soon
we seek success. The effects of such deci-
sions on our domestic economic con-
cerns-jobs, prices, foreign competitionâ€”
require explicit and rigorous analyses to
permit us to maintain a healthy economy
while we seek a healthy environment. It
is essential that we have both. It is simplis-
tic to seek ecological perfection at the cost
of bankrupting the very tax-paying enter-
prises which must pay for the social ad-
vances the nation seeks.
We must develop a realistic sense of
what it will cost to achieve our national
environmental goals and choose a specific
level of goal with an understanding of its
costs and benefits. One of the strengths of

you for this wonderful welcome to New

many pleasant memories of this State
going back over many years. But I think

than ever. Thank you very much for com-

to a great common goal. The achievement
of that goal will challenge the creativity
of our science and technology, the enter-

responsiveness and sense of balance of our
political and legal institutions, and the
resourcefulness and the capacity of this
country to honor those human values
upon which the quality of our national
life must ultimately depend.
