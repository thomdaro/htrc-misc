Richard Nixon, 1971

multaneously to cope with a minor con-
tingency elsewhere. This decision re-
flected our assessment of certain new fac-
tors that I outlined in last year's report:
-"the nuclear capability of our stra-
tegic and theater nuclear forces serves
as a deterrent to full-scale Soviet at-
tack on NATO Europe or Chinese
attack on our Asian allies;
-"the prospects for a coordinated two-
front attack on our allies by Russia
and China are low both because of
the risks of nuclear war and the im-
probability of Sino-Soviet coopera-
tion. In any event, we do not believe
that such a coordinated attack should
be met primarily by U.S. conven-
tional forces;
-"the desirability of insuring against
greater than expected threats by
maintaining more than the forces re-
quired to meet conventional threats
in one theater-such as NATO
Europe;
-"weakness on our part would be
more provocative than continued
U.S. strength, for it might encourage
others to take dangerous risks, to re-
sort to the illusion that military ad-
venturism could succeed."
GUIDELINES FOR GENERAL PURPOSE
FORCES
In this past year, we have continued to
shape our general purpose forces to those
concepts. Our guidelines were the
following:
-Both the USSR and the Chinese have
substantial forces that can be rapidly
reinforced. Our capabilities thus
must rest on our allies' strength,
strong U.S. overseas forces, and the
availability of credible reinforce-
ments. We could not hide deficien-
cies from a potential enemy; weak-
ness in conventional forces invites
conventional attack.
-To serve as a realistic deterrent, our
general purpose forces, together with
those of our allies, must be such as
to convince potential enemies that
they have nothing to gain by launch-
ing conventional attacks.
-To deter conventional aggression, we
and our allies together must be ca-
pable of posing unacceptable risks to
potential enemies. We must not be
in a position of being able to employ
only strategic weapons to meet chal-
lenges to our interests. On the other
hand, having a full range of options
does not mean that we will neces-
sarily limit our response to the level
or intensity chosen by an enemy. Po-
tential enemies must know that we
will respond to whatever degree is
required to protect our interests.
They must also know that they will
only worsen their situation by esca-
lating the level of violence.
-It is our policy that future guerilla
and subversive threats should be
dealt with primarily by the indige-
nous forces of our allies. Consistent
with the Nixon Doctrine, we can
and will provide economic and mil-
itary assistance to supplement local
efforts where our interests are
involved.
-Our forces will be developed and
deployed to the extent possible on
the basis of a common strategy with
our allies and a common sharing
of the defense burden.
Since these forces are crucial to our
support for regional defense organizations,
they are discussed more fully elsewhere
