rated one category from another. This
meant that a small increase in outside
income, if it happened to move a person
from the top of one category to the bottom
of another, could cause an inequitable de-
crease in benefits-and could thus bring
about a lower overall income position.
Under the new formula, the size of a
person's benefits will change by a few cents
every time his income changes by one dol-
lar. Instead of more than 20 rigid cate-
gories, there will now be a much finer
tuning of benefit amounts to an individ-
ual's income position. The danger of
abrupt declines in pensions will thus be
eliminated, and most recipients can be
sure that when their outside income goes
up, their overall income position will go
up also.
The amount of benefits lost for each
outside dollar received will be scaled
pro-
gressively, so that those with lowest in-
comes will receive the most help. Under
the new pension formula, for example, a
single veteran whose outside income is
above $2,200 will lose 7 cents in pension
for every dollar of additional outside in-
come. But if a veteran's income is below
$1,000, his reduction rate will be only 3
cents in pension per dollar of additional
outside income.
H.R. 11651 also provides that the ceil-
ing on the amount of outside income a
pensioner can receive before he loses all
benefits will be raised by $300. It raises
the ceiling by the same amount for the
13.6 percent of pensioners whose benefits
are still determined under the flat-pay-
ment system in use before 1960. H.R.
11652 extends this same consideration to
the dependent parents of deceased veter-
ans. The two bills make a number of addi-
tional changes in our pension and compen-
sation programs.
I have signed this legislation with the
greatest pleasure. Along with other recom-
mendations we have made and other ac-
tions we have taken, it can have a very
direct impact for good in the lives of mil-
lions of Americans who deserve the very
best from their country.
