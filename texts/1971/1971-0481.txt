Richard Nixon, 1971
[98]
Mar. 12
had been out for about 5 years before I
went into the service. I had been practic-
ing law.
You see, I left law school in 1937, and I
came here in 1942, so I had been out 5
years. And every year you are away from
school it is harder to go back to school,
I find, at least.
But I must say that it was an experi-
ence that, looking back, I, of course, do
not regret. It is one of those things you
say, "I wouldn't have missed it, but I
wouldn't want to do it again."
Q. Where did you go from here, Mr.
President?
THE PRESIDENT. You know, you apply
for something, and they give you some-
thing else. That hasn't changed, I
understand.
I went to what was the Naval Air Sta-
tion at Ottumwa, Iowa. And I will tell
you, when I got there, it was a cornfield
and nothing else. For 5 months we worked
on that station. I was aide to the executive
officer and later aide to the commanding
officer.
When I left there to go overseas we had
an airstrip, and it was one of the major
training bases for Navy pilots.
Q. Ottumwa?
THE PRESIDENT. Ottumwa. O-t-t-u-
m-w-a. It is a major meatpacking center
in Iowa.
Then from there, after my 5 months
there, I went overseas and served in the
South Pacific for about a 14-month tour.
Q. Do you have happy memories of
Quonset?
THE PRESIDENT. Yes. Well, the first 2
or 3 weeks were the hardest. You know,
learning to you have to shine your shoes.
Q. I can tell you did those pretty well.
THE PRESIDENT. Oh, I didn't do this.
I never got very high marks for that.
Because you know, you shine your shoes
and your clothes have to be straight and
you have got to stand straight. You learn
all of those things that really are so foreign
to a civilian. But I think humility is good
for any individual. And one thing you
learn when you go in the service, particu-
larly somebody who comes, as I did, from
a pretty good educational background-
and I was reasonably successful as a law-
yer-and then you go in there, and, as
I said a moment ago, the chiefs run the
Navy. Believe me, those Navy chiefs-
they put you in your place and that is
good for anybody.
Thank
you.

98 Address at Graduation Exercises of the Naval Officer
Candidate School, Newport, Rhode Island.
March 12, 1971
Admiral Colbert, Captain Farrell, Gover-
nor Licht, Secretary DeSimone, all of the
distinguished guests on the platform, the
distinguished guests at this occasion, and,
of course, most important of all, the mem-
bers of the graduating class:
I very much appreciated the personal
remarks that were made by the Admiral
and also by the leader of this class. I have
only one correction to makeâ€”not a very
important one-but when I finished
Quonset Point, I was a lieutenant, junior
427
