The remaining $11 billion will be in
the form of special revenue sharing, with
the discretion on how it will be used within
each of six broad subject areas strictly a
State and local matter. These areas are:
-Urban community development,
--Rural community development,
-Education,
-Manpower training,
-Law enforcement, and
-Transportation.
The hobbling restrictions now on much
of the Federal aid in these areas would be
removed, along with matching require-
ments that presently force localities to
spend their own matching money on low-
priority projects for fear of "losing" avail-
able Federal aid.
To emphasize the importance of the
special revenue sharing funds, the change
from the present tightly restrictive cate-
gorical grants to special revenue sharing
in the six broad areas will be accom-
panied by an increase of $709 million in
the amounts budgeted for 1972 for Fed-
eral aid to States and localities. But even
more important is the fact that these
governments would have far greater free-
dom of action in deciding how money is
to be spent within each of the six areas.
For example, although the Federal Gov-
ernment would designate the total amount
of special revenue sharing for education,
the State or local area would decide how
much is to be spent on new textbooks, new
schools, equipment, or other matters of
priority to it in the field of education.
In this way, both general and special
revenue sharing will redirect the control
of State and local decisions on $16.1 bil-
lion to the States and localities affected
most by those decisions. This is about half
of Federal Government aid, excluding
public assistance grants, to States and
communitiesâ€”a historic and massive re-
versal of the flow of power in America.

We must make provision at the outset
of this freedom of action plan for both
growing State and local needs and grow-
ing State and local capacity to manage
their affairs.
The new funds for general revenue
sharing will grow in years to come be-
cause they will be tied to the Federal
personal income tax base. As that tax base
expands, more unrestricted money will
flow to States and localities.
To help State and local governments
develop greater capacity to plan and
manage their own affairs, I will send to
the Congress a planning-management as-
sistance plan, which will provide $100
million to help these governments make
their own long-range plans and enhance
their capability for the efficient use of
their growing revenues.
In essence, this is what revenue sharing
will do:
--for the individual taxpayer, it will
provide a stronger voice in how his
tax money is spent locally, new con-
