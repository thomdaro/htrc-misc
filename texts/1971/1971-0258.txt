Public Papers of the Presidents
the remedies aside has not sufficed to put
the problems aside. These remain. They
must be dealt with.
Accordingly, I am again submitting
proposals designed to provide such a
Buyer's Bill of Rights by:
-Creating by Executive Order a new
Office of Consumer Affairs in the
Executive Office of the President
which will be responsible for analyz-
ing and coordinating all Federal
activities in the field of consumer
protection;
-Recognizing the need for effective
representation of consumer interests
in the regulatory process and making
recommendations to accomplish this
after full public discussion of the
findings of the Advisory Council on
Executive Organization;
-Establishing within the Department
of Health, Education, and Welfare a
product safety program. The Sec-
retary of Health, Education, and
Welfare would have authority to fix
minimum safety standards for prod-
ucts and to ban from the market-
place those products that fail to meet
those standards;
-Proposing a Consumer Fraud Pre-
vention Act which would make un-
lawful a broad but clearly-defined
range of practices which are unfair
and deceptive to consumers and
would be enforced by the Depart-
ment of Justice and the Federal
Trade Commission. This act, where
appropriate, would also enable con-
sumers either as individuals or as a
class to go into court to recover dam-
ages for violations of the act;
-Proposing amendments to the Fed-
eral Trade Commission Act which
will increase the effectiveness of the
Federal Trade Commission;
-Calling upon interested private citi-
zens to undertake a thorough study
of the adequacy of existing proce-
dures for the resolution of disputes
arising out of consumer transactions;
-Proposing a Fair Warranty Disclo-
sure Act which will provide for
clearer warranties, and prohibit the
use of deceptive warranties;
-Proposing a Consumer Products Test
Methods Act to provide incentives
for increasing the amount of accurate
and relevant information provided
consumers about complex consumer
products;
-Resubmitting the Drug Identifica-
tion Act which would require identi-
fication coding of all drug tablets and
capsules;
-Encouraging the establishment of a
National Business Council to assist
the business community in meeting
its responsibilities to the consumer;
and by
-Other reforms, including exploration
of a Consumer Fraud Clearinghouse
in the Federal Trade Commission, in-
creased emphasis on consumer edu-
cation and new programs in the field
of food and drug safety.
NEW OFFICE OF CONSUMER AFFAIRS
The President's Committee on Con-
sumer Interests has made important gains
on behalf of the American consumer in
the past two years.
It has brought a new and innovative
approach to the problem of keeping the
consumer informed and capable of han-
dling the complex choices presented to
him in today's commercial world. One
such measure involves the dissemination
