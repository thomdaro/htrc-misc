Public Papers of the Presidents
nomic Opportunity will emphasize its
leadership role in research, development,
and evaluation in social programs.
IMPROVING OUR ENVIRONMENT
The improvement and prudent use of
our physical resources is vital to our
Nation's prosperity and to the goal of
helping all Americans enjoy a clean en-
vironment, adequate housing, and a better
standard of living. In 1972, outlays to
achieve these objectives will increase by
$2.4 billion to $26.1 billion. The actions.
that I am proposing will:
—expand my administration's vigorous
efforts to protect and enhance the
quality of our environment and rec-
reation resources;
-revitalize housing and community
development programs; and
-increase Federal research and devel-
opment efforts.
ENVIRONMENTAL QUALITY.--The pri-
mary responsibility for protecting and en-
hancing the environment lies with State
and local governments, industry, and the
public, but the Federal Government
must—and will-provide vigorous leader-
ship.
During the past year, this administra-
tion moved forcefully to exercise that
leadership:
• Major Federal pollution control and
abatement activities were consoli-
dated in a new Environmental Pro-
tection Agency;
•
·
The Council on Environmental
Quality was given a major role
within the Executive Office of the
President to advise on environmental
problems and on national policies to
deal with them;
New legislation to strengthen na-
·
tional efforts for reducing pollution
was proposed to the Congress; and
Funds for major environmental
quality programs were increased
significantly.
Pollution control and abatement pro-
grams will get even greater attention in
the 1972 budget. Outlays will be increased
by $764 million. Budget authority will rise
even more, by $1.3 billion. The higher
amounts will provide for:
-doubling grants for municipal waste
treatment facilities;
—curbing pollution from Federal
facilities;
-expanding EPA pollution control
operations, including implementa-
tion of new air quality and solid waste
legislation; and
-developing new pollution abatement
techniques.
Legislation is again proposed to create
the Environmental Financing Authority,
which will assist communities that have
difficulty in borrowing at reasonable rates
to meet their share of the cost of water
pollution control facilities.
I shall shortly propose, in a special
message to the Congress, a series of fur-
ther measures to control pollution and
improve the quality of our environment.
RECREATION.-Greater opportunity for
leisure is valued highly in America and,
as a result, the demand for recreation fa-
cilities is growing. The 1972 budget pro-
poses a substantial increase in grants to
help State and local governments provide
some of these facilities.
I am recommending that the Land and
Water Conservation Fund be fully funded
to provide:
-grants of $280 million to help States
and localities meet local recreation
needs; and
