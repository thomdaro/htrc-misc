know that the sure result of a nuclear
attack against us is unacceptable damage
from our retaliation. That makes it im-
perative that our strategic power not be
inferior to that of any other state. Thus I
am committed to my pledge to keep our
strategic forces strong. I am equally com-
mitted to seeking a stable strategic rela-
tionship with the Soviet Union through
negotiations. There is no inconsistency
between those goals; they are in fact
complementary.
THE STRATEGIC BALANCE
Last year I reported on a new strategic
policy for the 1970's. In assessing the
changed strategic relationship, we faced
the following realities:
-Until the late 1960's, we possessed
strategic forces that provided a clear
margin of superiority.
-In the late 1960's, however, the bal-
ance of strategic forces changed.
While our forces were held at existing
levels, the Soviet Union moved for-
ward vigorously to develop powerful
and sophisticated strategic forces
which approached, and in some cate-
gories exceeded, ours in numbers and
capability.
By any standard, we believe the number
of Soviet strategic forces now exceeds the
level needed for deterrence. Even more
important than the growth in numbers has
been the change in the nature of the forces
the USSR chose to develop and deploy.
These forces include systems-particu-
larly the SS-9 ICBM with large multiple
warheads-which, if further improved
and deployed in sufficient numbers, could
be uniquely suitable for a first strike
against our land-based deterrent forces.
The design and growth of these forces
leads inescapably to profound questions
concerning the threats we will face in the
future, and the adequacy of our current
strategic forces to meet the requirements
of our security. Specifically:
-Does the Soviet Union simply seek a
retaliatory capability, thus permitting
the pursuit of meaningful limitations
on strategic arms?
-Or does the Soviet Union seek forces
which could attack and destroy vital
elements of our retaliatory capabil-
ity, thus requiring us to respond with
additional programs of our own, in-
volving another round of arms
competition?
The past year has not provided defini-
tive answers. Clearly, however, the USSR,
over the past year, has continued to add
significantly to its capabilities.

By the mid-1970's we expect the Soviets
to have a force of ballistic missile sub-
marines equal in size to our own. Further-
more, the Soviet Union has continued to
make significant qualitative improve-
ments in its strategic forces. These in-
