only when there is peace for its neighbors.
Hanoi has made the war an Indochina
conflict. In South Vietnam there are some
100,000 North Vietnamese troops. In Laos
there are about 90,000. In Cambodia
there are over 50,000 North Vietnamese
and Viet Cong. These troops challenge
the legitimate governments of Laos and
Cambodia, and they menace South Viet-
nam from within and without.
The situations in Laos and Cambodia
are comparable:
-Neither one poses any threat to
North Vietnam.
-North Vietnam, nevertheless, has for
years been violating their neutrality
and independence, guaranteed in in-
ternational accords which Hanoi and
its allies signed.
-In both countries North Vietnamese
regular troops strip away any pretense
of civil war. In Laos indigenous
Pathet Lao play an insignificant
military role, while in Cambodia only
small numbers of Cambodians help
the North Vietnamese and Viet
Cong.
-In both countries Hanoi has two
aims. First, and primarily, to use
them as infiltration routes, staging
bases, and sanctuaries for attacks
against South Vietnam. Secondly, to
erode governmental control in or-
der to aid their efforts in South Viet-
nam and perhaps take over Laos and
Cambodia themselves.
United States Policy
This canvas poses two fundamental
questions for the United States:
-What should be our policy toward
Laos and Cambodia as countries un-
der external attack?
-How do we deal with the major im-
plications for our policy in South
Vietnam?
North Vietnam's aggression against
Laos and Cambodia and its violation of
the 1954 and 1962 Geneva Agreements
are important. We care about the pres-
ervation of international agreements and
the independence of these nations. But
our immediate concern is that North Viet-
nam uses them as springboards for assaults
on a country where we have a firm com-
mitment, have invested lives, treasure,
and prestige, and have Americans to pro-
tect as we progressively withdraw. Fur-
thermore, if Hanoi were to gain control
of Laos and Cambodia, a large portion
of the more than 140,000 Communist
troops now engaged in these countries
would be freed to fight in South Vietnam.
As we pursued our policy of Vietnami-
zation and negotiation for Vietnam we
could not ignore these unavoidable facts
on its flank. Our basic choices for Laos
and Cambodia became:
-to seek diplomatic settlements for
both countries, either as part of an
all-Indochina
arrangement or
separately.
-to provide military support both to
Laos and Cambodia and to South
Vietnamese defensive operations,
without U.S. ground combat in-
volvement.
We have always wished to stabilize the
borders of South Vietnam and to insure
the neutrality of its neighbors by diplo-
matic means. My October 7 peace initia-
tive, supported by the three governments,
proposed for all of Indochina:
—a ceasefire to stop the fighting.
-an international conference to seal
the
peace.
—the immediate release of all prisoners
of war.
