nations and a vigorous leadership
role for multilateral development
institutions;
-recognize that other nations have a
growing ability and responsibility to
determine their own development
priorities;
-continue security assistance at a
higher level than in recent years in
order to help friendly nations meet
the responsibility for their own de-
fense; and
-improve coordination of our human-
itarian assistance efforts.
These changes will carry out a major
theme of U.S. foreign policy-less direct
U.S. involvement in the affairs of other
nations, less potential for friction and re-
sentment, and a stable world order more
conducive to lasting peace.
MEETING HUMAN NEEDS
The proposals that I submit today are a
major step forward in the reform of our
Nation's efforts to meet the needs of its
206 million citizens. They will introduce
a new fairness into American life by
providing:
-a basic income floor under every
family with children in this Nation;
—health care to help make needed serv-
ices possible for all of our people
when and where such services are
required;
-better systems of support for educa-
tion and manpower training; and
-continued progress in assuring the
civil rights of all citizens, and in con-
trolling crime.
INCOME STRATEGY.-Last year was one
of great promise for the long-term income
security of American families. Some of
that promise reached fruition in the re-
form of unemployment insurance and
food stamp programs:
•
Unemployment insurance was ex-
tended to 4.8 million additional
Americans, including farmworkers
and hospital workers, and special
extended benefits were established to
be triggered automatically by ad-
verse economic conditions.
• Food stamp benefits were improved
by establishing national eligibility
standards, requiring family allot-
ments large enough to purchase an
adequate diet, providing free food
stamps to the poorest recipients, and
automatically raising benefits with
increases in the cost of living.
However, much of that promise was left
unrealized. As I have pointed out, in 1972
I will redouble my efforts to make essen-
tial and fundamental reforms in income
maintenance programs. First, and fore-
most, I will seek:
• Basic welfare reform.-Last year I
proposed that our archaic and de-
meaning welfare system be reformed.
A landmark plan that would have
accomplished this was approved by
the House but did not come to a
vote in the Senate.
The urgency of the need for wel-
fare reform grows with every passing
day. I have already stressed the need
for early enactment of the Welfare
Reform Act of 1971 by the 92d
Congress.
This plan would remove the prin-
cipal evils of the existing system by:
--setting national eligibility
standards;
--balancing strong training and
work requirements with equally
strong training and work
incentives;
