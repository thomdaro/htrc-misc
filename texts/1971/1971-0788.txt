Public Papers of the Presidents
do a great deal to help in meeting this
challenge.
My program includes the following
elements:
To Facilitate Research and Development
for Clean Energy:
-A commitment to complete the suc-
cessful demonstration of the liquid
metal fast breeder reactor by 1980.
-More than twice as much Federal
support for sulfur oxide control dem-
onstration projects in Fiscal Year
1972.
-An expanded program to convert
coal into a clean gaseous fuel.
-Support for a variety of other energy
research projects in fields such as
fusion power, magnetohydrodynamic
power cycles, and underground elec-
tric transmission.
To Make Available the Energy Resources
on Federal Lands:
â€”Acceleration of oil and gas lease sales
on the Outer Continental Shelf,
along with stringent controls to pro-
tect the environment.
-A leasing program to develop our
vast oil shale resources, provided that
environmental questions can be satis-
factorily resolved.
-Development of a geothermal leasing
program beginning this fall.
To Assure a Timely Supply of Nuclear
Fuels:
-Begin work to modernize and expand
our uranium enrichment capacity.
To Use Our Energy More Wisely:
---A New Federal Housing Administra-
tion standard requiring additional in-
sulation in new federally insured
homes.
-Development and publication of ad-
ditional information on how con-
sumers can use energy more
efficiently.
-Other efforts to encourage energy
conservation.
To Balance Environmental and Energy
Needs:
A system of long-range open plan-
ning of electric power plant sites and
transmission line routes with ap-
proval by a State or regional agency
before construction.
-An incentive charge to reduce sulfur
oxide emissions and to support fur-
ther research.
To Organize Federal Efforts More
Effectively:
-A single structure within the Depart-
ment of Natural Resources uniting
all important energy resource de-
velopment programs.
THE NATURE OF THE CURRENT
PROBLEM
A major cause of our recent energy
problems has been the sharp increase in
demand that began about 1967. For dec-
ades, energy consumption had generally
grown at a slower rate than the national
output of goods and services. But in the
last four years it has been growing at a
faster pace and forecasts of energy de-
mand a decade from now have been un-
dergoing significant upward revisions.
This accelerated growth in demand re-
sults partly from the fact that energy has
been relatively inexpensive in this coun-
try. During the last decade, the prices of
oil, coal, natural gas and electricity have
increased at a much slower rate than con-
