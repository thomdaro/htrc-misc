Public Papers of the Presidents
television-maybe stand up, I think, so
that I can recognize you, and speak up,
please.
QUESTIONS
DEVELOPMENTS IN MAINLAND CHINA
[2.] Q. What's happening in Red
China?
THE PRESIDENT. It would be
presump-
tuous for me to contend that we knew
what was happening on the mainland of
China at this time. I will only say, how-
ever, that whatever is happening, we are
proceeding with the plans for the trip
that I will be taking to the People's Re-
public of China.
Those plans will be announced at an
appropriate time, and in that context you
can surmise anything you want as to what
is happening.
MEETING WITH CHINESE LEADERS
[3] Q. Mr. President, you said in De-
troit you would meet with the leader of
Red China. Do you expect that to be Mao
Tse-tung?
THE PRESIDENT. In any meeting that
occurs with a leader of a Communist
country, a meeting must occur not only
with the head of government, which in
this
case, of course, would be Chou En-lai,
the Premier, but it must also occur with
the Chairman of the Communist Party
in that country.
Putting it in another context, if a meet-
ing were to be held in the Soviet Union,
the meeting would be between the Presi-
dent of the United States and Mr. Kosy-
gin, and also a meeting between the
President of the United States and
Mr. Brezhnev.
Now, as far as the meetings in China
are concerned, they will be announced,
and those who participate in them, at an
appropriate time. It would be naturally
assumed that when the trip is planned,
that a meeting would be planned, a meet-
ing or meetings, with the head of govern-
ment and with the Chairman of the
Communist Party of the People's
Republic.
ALASKA NUCLEAR TEST
[4.] Q. Mr. President, when you go to
Alaska, are you going to make any state-
ment on the Amchitka blast, or has that
been determined or decided-the under-
ground nuclear blast?
THE PRESIDENT. I noted the specula-
tion to the effect that I might make a
statement on the blast at that time. I have
no plans to make an announcement at
that time. As you know, the various factors
involved are under study, and a decision
will be made soon, but the decision will
not be announced before or at the time of
my visit to Anchorage.
THE DOCK STRIKE
[5.] Q. Mr. President, may we return
again to the question of the dock strike?
THE PRESIDENT. Certainly, anything
you like.
Q. May we feel here that you came
away from the meeting encouraged?
THE PRESIDENT. I am sure it would
not give away any confidence if I were to
report to this group that as we concluded
our meeting, I said to Mr. Bridges and to
Mr. Flynn, "Can I go and tell the mem-
bers of the press that I am encouraged by
this meeting?"
Mr. Bridges, who is quite a skilled nego-
tiator, and I have known him for over 20
