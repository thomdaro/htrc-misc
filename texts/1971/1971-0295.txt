private capital as beneficial to their eco-
nomic expansion and consistent with their
national policies. I will therefore shortly
ask the Congress to provide authority to
extend guarantees to American private
investment in both countries. This is to
our mutual benefit.
Romania and Yugoslavia have indi-
cated by their policies a desire for cordial
relations with the United States on the
basis of reciprocity. Our relations have
continued to improve because the pace
and scope is determined in the first in-
stance by them. We are responsive, and
other countries in Eastern Europe who
desire better relations with us will find

ISSUES FOR THE FUTURE
Within our evolving Atlantic commu-
nity, we must deepen and extend our
unity:
-to complete the transition from
American predominance to a more
nearly equal partnership, sharing
the responsibilities of leadership.
-to reaffirm our commitment to coop-

must:
-continue our close Allied consulta-

negotiations progress.
-harmonize our individual approaches
to insure that they are comple-
mentary, and preserve the cohesion
and stability which make d√©tente
possible.
-seek to engage our adversaries in
negotiations addressing the concrete
issues that keep Europe divided.
I have repeatedly emphasized that the
Nixon Doctrine is a philosophy of in-
vigorated partnership, not a synonym for
American withdrawal. Our relationship
with Western Europe proves it.

. all of us come from and were
born to this world, our nations, through
violent revolution. Now our charge and
our task is to provide the means and the
method through which those great
changes that need to be made in the
world, in our own countries and in the
world, can be made through peaceful
change."

independence from the Old World. It
