authorize the remaining $900 million of
our proportionate contribution. I also
urge the Congress to authorize $100 mil-
lion for our contribution to the Special
Fund of the Asian Development Bank.
We have also pledged our support for
other mechanisms of regional cooperation
such as the Inter-American Committee
for the Alliance for Progress, the new ar-
rangements for regional integration in
Latin America, the Mekong River De-
velopment Committee, and the promising
links among nations in East and West
Africa.
In addition to our direct support of
these regional organizations, one purpose
of our desire to see aid untied is to permit
developing countries to use foreign as-
sistance to purchase goods from one an-
other in order to support greater trade
among them. Indeed, our own decision to
permit all developing countries to par-
ticipate in the provision of commodities
financed under U.S. assistance programs
is already encouraging an expansion of
such trade.
For trade expansion plays an important
part in our new strategy for development.
Developing nations wish to rely more on
their own economies to provide jobs and
earn the foreign exchange they need; they
wish to become less reliant on aid. We
share this objective with them. We have
sought to enhance their trading positions
by pressing for concerted action among
the industrialized nations on a generalized
system of tariff preferences in the in-

dustrialized markets for the exports of all
of the lower income countries. I am ex-
tremely pleased that the discussions
among the developed countries in 1970
produced broad movement toward a
worldwide system of comparable gen-
eralized preference schemes. I will shortly
be submitting legislation to authorize U.S.
participation in this program.
The Downward Trend Reversed. Our
foreign aid appropriation for FY 1971,
signed into law last month, increases all
categories of our bilateral economic as-
sistance over last year. This follows
This follows upon
an increase in FY 1970 over the level of
FY 1969. Thus we are well on our way
toward accomplishing one of the basic
objectives which I stated in my special
message on foreign assistance of Septem-
ber 15, 1970-to reverse the downward
trend in U.S. foreign assistance.
Since I took office, appropriations for
bilateral economic aid have risen as fol-
lows (in millions of dollars):
