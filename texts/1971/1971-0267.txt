to survive but to build a strong, free
society.
Thanks to the disruption of so much of
the enemy's supplies, Americans are leav-
ing South Vietnam in safety; we would
much prefer to leave South Vietnam in
peace. Negotiation remains the best and
quickest way to end the war in a way that
will not only end U.S. involvement and
casualties but will mean an end to the
fighting between North and South
Vietnamese.
On October 7, we made a proposal that
could open the door to that kind of peace.
We proposed:
-an immediate standstill cease-fire
throughout Indochina to stop the
fighting,
-an Indochina peace conference,
-the withdrawal of all outside forces,
-a political settlement fair to both
sides,
-the immediate release of all prisoners
of war.
I reaffirm that proposal today. It is
supported by every government in Indo-
china except one-the Government of
North Vietnam.
I once again urge Hanoi to join us in
this search for peace.
If North Vietnam wishes to negotiate
with the United States, they will have to
recognize that time is running out. With
the exception of the prisoners-of-war issue,
if North Vietnam continues to refuse to
discuss our peace proposals, they will soon
find they have no choice but to negotiate
only with the South Vietnamese.
Our eventual goal is a total withdrawal
of all outside forces. But as long as North
Vietnam continues to hold a single Amer-
ican prisoner, we shall have forces in
South Vietnam. The American prisoners
of war will not be forgotten by their
Government.
I am keeping my pledge to end Amer-
ica's involvement in this war. But the
main point I want to discuss with you
today and the main theme of my report
to the Congress is the future, not the
past. It matters very much how we end
this war.
To end a war is simple.
But to end a war in a way that will not
bring on another war is far from simple.
In Southeast Asia today, aggression is
failing thanks to the determination of
the South Vietnamese people and to the
courage and sacrifice of America's fight-
ing men.
That brings us to a point that we have
been at several times before in this cen-
tury: aggression turned back, a war
ending.
We are at a critical moment in history:
What America does—or fails to do—will
determine whether peace and freedom
can be won in the coming generation.
That is why the way in which we end
this conflict is so crucial to our efforts to
build a lasting peace in coming decades.
The right way out of Vietnam is crucial
to our changing role in the world and to
peace in the world.
To understand the nature of the new
American role we must consider the great
historical changes that have taken place.
For 25 years after World War II, the
United States was not only the leader of
the non-Communist world, it was the pri-
mary supporter and defender of this free
world as well.
-But today our allies and friends have
gained new strength and self-
confidence. They are now able to
participate much more fully not only
