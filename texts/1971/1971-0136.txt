If this careful scrutiny were not main-
tained-if we weaken in our resolve to
control spending-we would risk per-
mitting outlays to build up a momentum
that will carry them beyond full employ-
ment receipts in the longer run, and we
would risk losing the ability to restrain
spending in times when a deficit is
undesirable.
SUMMARY OF THE 1972 BUDGET
The budget that I propose for 1972 is
consistent with the fiscal policy I an-
nounced 6 months ago.
Budget receipts in 1972 are estimated to
be $217.6 billion, $23.4 billion more than
in
1971, but still below the $229.3 billion
of revenue that would be produced if the
economy were operating at full employ-
ment throughout the year.
The estimates reflect a reduction in
revenues of $2.7 billion due to the new tax
depreciation rules announced on Janu-
ary 11. These rules are part of our plan
to expand the economy and help the
Nation achieve full employment without
inflation.
Budget outlays in 1972 are expected to
be $229.2 billion, an increase of $16.4 bil-
lion over the previous year.
The increase in outlays will help move
the economy toward higher employment
and production. At the same time, outlays
are being held to full employment receipts.
I am requesting budget authority-the
right to make commitments to spend-of
$249.0 billion in 1972. Over $170 billion
of this total will require new action on
the part of the Congress.
