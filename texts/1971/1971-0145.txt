GUARANTEEING
CIVIL RIGHTS.-The
ideals of our Nation require that the civil
rights of all citizens be respected, regard-
less of race, sex, religion, or national
origin.
My budget for 1972 proposes
strengthen our efforts to eliminate dis-
crimination in private as well as Federal
employment, in activities supported by
Federal assistance to State and local gov-
ernments and other recipients, in educa-
tion, in housing, and in other aspects of
society.
We will take these specific steps to im-
prove the lives of all our people:
-increase by more than 50% our
efforts to prevent employment dis-
crimination by Federal contractors
and other private employers;
-increase nearly threefold the Federal
assistance to school districts that are
desegregating;
-reorganize the field operations of the
Equal Employment Opportunity
Commission to make more effective
efforts to halt discrimination in pri-
vate employment;
-focus the activities of the Civil Serv-
ice Commission to assure equal Fed-
eral employment opportunities for all
our citizens, with special emphasis on
opportunity for Spanish-surnamed
Americans;
-serve 46 localities with conciliation
assistance through the Community
Relations Service;
-expand administration of the fair
housing and equal opportunity laws
to increase residential housing
choices for all Americans; and
-increase by 15% funds to agencies
to assure nondiscrimination by recipi-
ents in their use of Federal assistance.
EDUCATION AND MANPOWER TRAIN-
ING. The education and manpower
training programs proposed in this budget
reflect my determination to find better
ways to carry out Federal programs.
Special revenue sharing is proposed for
both of these vital areas. I will also submit
major reform proposals to:
-reform Federal aid programs for
higher education to increase their
effectiveness;
-direct more funds to students from
lower income working families;
-establish a National Institute of Edu-
cation for research and development;
and
-provide additional training oppor-
tunities and strong incentives under
the Welfare Reform Act of 1971 for
employable welfare recipients to
undertake suitable employment or
job training.
