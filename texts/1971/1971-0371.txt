our worldwide interests.
This may impose new requirements and
new burdens in the coming decade. We
would prefer that rivalry with the USSR
be contained through self-restraint,
mutual respect for interests, and specific
agreements. But I am determined that
our general military posture will remain
as strong as the international situation
dictates.
AGENDA FOR THE FUTURE
While maintaining a realistic deterrent,
we will further adjust our general purpose
forces in response to changing circum-
stances. Our attention, for example, will
be focused on:
-Manpower. Our ultimate goal is to
meet our military manpower require-
ments without resort to the draft. In
the meantime, we are working on
reform of the selective service system.
We have adopted a new method of
selection to ensure a more equitable
spreading of the burden of military
service, and reduce to a minimum the
uncertainties associated with the
draft. Draft calls have been sub-
stantially reduced. As Vietnamization
progresses, and our program of up-
grading the rewards of the career
service takes effect, we hope to make
further reductions.
-NATO. We and our NATO Allies
have agreed to improve the quality
of alliance forces. In 1971, we will
move to concrete programs for im-
proving NATO's conventional capa-
bilities, and insuring modern and
sufficient strategic and theater
nuclear forces.
-Asia. We will, with our allies, deter-
mine how best to help them improve
their defensive capabilities. This will
enable us to deal with the allocation
of resources between U.S. forces and
increased assistance in the area.
-Defense Review. We have defined
new strategic doctrines for our nu-
clear forces and for our general pur-
pose forces. But we must continue
to refine our assessments of the im-
plications of our strategies for
our force composition. This will
be
a continuing task of this
Administration.
We will also be taking measures to in-
crease the efficiency and effectiveness of
our defense establishment. The Secretary
of Defense is reviewing the proposals of
the Blue Ribbon Defense Panel on the
organization and management of the
Department of Defense. He has imple-
mented many of them, and is preparing
his recommendations to me on others.
These matters will be covered fully in the
Secretary's Defense Report to the
Congress.
SECURITY ASSISTANCE
"The overwhelming evidence of the last
25 years from the Marshall Plan to
Vietnamization-is that a systematic
program that helps other nations harness
their own resources for defense and devel-
opment enables them to take on the pri-
mary burden of their own defense."
