Richard Nixon, 1971
July 31 [244]
He was a man who loved his country, and
he set a magnificent example for people
all over the country.
I think that if you were to pick one man
who has more caught the imagination of
the Nation in the field of sports it is prob-
ably Vince Lombardi because of his
character.
MR. GIFFORD. He certainly had that.
Of course, the other inductees that are
being inducted in the Hall of Fame, Y. A.
Tittle, Jim Brown, Bruiser Kinard, Andy
Robustelli, Hewitt-
THE PRESIDENT. I remember so well,
the time that I met both Y. A. Tittle and
Andy Robustelli was in your apartment,
Frank, in New York, in 1962. You know,
in those years you had those great Giant
teams-I don't mean they aren't so great
now.
MR. GIFFORD. It was close to a cham-
pionship team.
THE PRESIDENT. Well, they were
championship in my book. And I recall
the great time we had, and what fun it
was just to sit there and talk football. I
have often thought that if I had my life
to live over again and did not go into
politics I would like to have your jobâ€”
you know, be a sportscaster or writer.
MR. GIFFORD. We do have a good seat.
THE PRESIDENT. Yes. Well, possibly if
I am not too old you will give me the
chance later.
MR. GIFFORD. I have heard
very fine color job once before.

Where did the interest in football,
physical fitness, athletics in general-I
know you are a general sports fan-but
where did it begin, back at Whittier
maybe with Chief Newman, the head
coach?
THE PRESIDENT. Yes. Whittier, as you
know, right next to Southern Cal, is a
small college, but with a very fine football
tradition. And my coach, Chief Newman,
of course, was an alumnus of your college,
or university, University of Southern Cali-
fornia. As a matter of fact, he was an
All-American.
MR. GIFFORD. He was a great player.
THE PRESIDENT. A great player. He
played tackle and fullback both, in the
days when they went both ways. He
played tackle on defense and fullback on
offense. But the Chief in a very interesting
way was a lot like Lombardi. He was a
fellow who produced good teams. I think
the thing that I remember most about him
was his attitude about being a good loser.
He said you ought to be a good loser. But
being a good loser to him-he said you
have got to hate to lose. You have got to
hate to lose and get up off that floor and
come back to fight again.
He got that into everyone who ever
played for him or, as I did, sat on the
bench and was on the taxi squad. And I
think perhaps that may have had an effect
on me. I had to lose a little before I won.
MR. GIFFORD. Mr. President, it is very
difficult now. I know you were a fan of
the Los Angeles Rams, a very good fan of
the Giants when you were in New York, a
fan of the Washington Redskins. Do you
find it difficult now to pick a team to root
for or do you just like it all?
THE PRESIDENT. Well first, Frank, as
President I have to be very nonpartisan,
and when I go to a game, consequently, it
is
very difficult because I like to be for a
team, for a man or for a team. I don't
mean being so much against the other
team, but for somebody I know.
But what I have now decided is the
best rule is to be for the team in the city
I happen to be living. Now that is the
Washington Redskins at the present time,
