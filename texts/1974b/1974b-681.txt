CONCLUSION
This list of legislative priorities represents a streamlined action program for

And the American people rightly expect us to do everything we can to accom-

I pledge my full cooperation with the Congress in the weeks ahead. I am confi-
dent that the Congress will respond in the same spirit.

an annual global quota of 7 million short tons for 1975. That quantity is more
than adequate to meet anticipated import requirements. At the same time, it will
