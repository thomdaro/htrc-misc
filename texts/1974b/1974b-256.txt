gives full weight to the findings of the full-scale BLS survey made this year in
the traditional manner. To depart from past practice by use of a special survey to
support a higher increase than can be justified by normal methods does not seem
to me to be the right thing to do at this time.
NOTE: On October 7, 1974, the President signed Executive Orders 11811 and 11812, providing for an
increase in Federal civilian and military pay.

Message to the Congress Transmitting the Cost of Living
Council's Final Quarterly Report on the Economic Stabilization
Program. October 1, 1974
To the Congress of the United States:
In accordance with section 216 of the Economic Stabilization Act of 1970, as
amended, I am hereby transmitting to the Congress the final quarterly report of
the Economic Stabilization Program. This report covers the first three months
of 1974 as well as the month of April, 1974-the last month before legislative
authority for the program expired.
When the Economic Stabilization Program was begun in 1971, President
Nixon emphasized his hope that it would be temporary. This objective has now
been met, as all mandatory wage and price controls have been lifted, except for
those on petroleum which have been mandated separately by the Congress.
Looking back, I believe this program gave all Americans a better appreciation
of how powerful the forces of inflation are in our economy and how difficult it is
to harness them. It also gave us convincing proof that wage and price controls
are not the right way to solve the long-range problems of our economy. In
retrospect, this may have been the program's greatest lasting value.
The White House,
October 1, 1974.
NOTE: The report, covering the period January 1
through May 1, 1974, is entitled "Economic Stabili-
