Statement on the Death of Paul G. Hoffman. October 8, 1974
PAUL GRAY HOFFMAN's life was not one success story but many. A tal-
ented, dynamic businessman, he went on to serve both America and the world
as an inspired public servant and a great humanitarian.
His work with the Studebaker Packard Corporation marked him as one of the
giants of American industry. At the end of World War II, as the first Admin-
istrator of the Marshall Plan, his intelligence and compassion helped to rebuild
a Europe that was in ruins. Mr. Hoffman served with equal distinction in im-
portant posts at the United Nations and with the Ford Foundation and the Fund
for the Republic.
His life was as long as it was eventful. To his wife Anna, a distinguished pub-
lic servant in her own right, and to the other members of the family, Mrs. Ford
and I express our deepest sympathy and regret on the passing of a great and be-
loved American.
NOTE: Mr. Hoffman, 86, died in New York City. On June 21, 1974, Mr. Hoffman was awarded the
Presidential Medal of Freedom.

Toasts of the President and First Secretary Gierek of
Poland. October 8, 1974
Mr. First Secretary and Mrs. Gierek, our wonderful guests:
It is a great privilege and pleasure to have you and Mrs. Gierek here with us
this evening. We have had a very delightful dinner, and we had a very helpful
and constructive discussion during the day, and I am looking forward to further
discussions tomorrow.
Mr. First Secretary, I come from a part of our country where we have roughly
30,000 people with a Polish heritage or background. And as I grew up, Mr. First
Secretary, I had many wonderful personal experiences with families that had a
Polish background, families that had the same great family strength, families
that had a tremendous religious dedication, individuals with a Polish heritage
that became leaders in our community, outstanding scholars, athletes, public
servants.
