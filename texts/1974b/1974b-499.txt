Gerald R. Ford, 1974
Yes, we need the kind of cooperation in the Congress to make sure that we
do what is right in Latin America, that we try to help Africa to become an
emerging continent, raising the levels that are so essential for them as well as for
others.
We need the kind of cooperation between the Congress and the President to
see that the Pacific does not have another kind of conflagration that lasted for

the peace, who believes we have a unique opportunity in this time in history to
build for peace, not for a year but for longer.
Now, I ask for your help. I ask for your supportâ€”not just for me, not for the
Republican Party, but for the country and millions and millions of people all
over the world.
Thank you very much.
NOTE: The President spoke at 8:40 p.m. at a dinner for Republican candidates in the Gold Room at the
Sheraton-Cleveland Hotel.

a new standard in determining the authority of the Secretary of the Interior to
allow certain rights-of-way across lands of the National Wildlife Refuge Sys-
tem. This new standard would require the Secretary to review all reasonable
alternatives to the use of such area, and then make a determination that the
