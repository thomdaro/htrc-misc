FOREWORD
THE SPEECHES, messages, press conferences and major statements contained
in this volume speak for themselves. They record not only the words and policies
of a new Presidential Administration but the momentous events of a critical
period in American history. No past Administration has begun its tenure in
office under more unusual circumstances than this one. At no time in history has
America faced quite the same mixture of problems, challenges and opportu-
nities as during the period covered in these pages. This volume shows how they
were met. Hopefully, it will help future generations to put into historical
perspective the many issues and events of this period.
The reader will find not one, but many stories: the story of a peaceful, Con-
stitutional transfer of power at the end of a long political ordeal; the story of a
foreign policy which, despite some setbacks, has succeeded in keeping American
prestige high and the chances for world peace strong; the story of a nation
grappling with the twin economic menaces of inflation and recession—a battle
partially won though still very real today.
But it is both my hope and my firm belief that there runs through all of these
varied themes an underlying note of American stability, character and strength:
stability in the midst of political shock and change; character in the preservation
of basic American values and institutions despite economic pressures and political
conflicts; and strength as America's resolve and diplomatic commitment success-
fully passed through a time of testing at home and abroad.
As this is written, the story still unfolds. America, on the threshold of her third
century, faces many new challenges, many new opportunities. But, as these pages
clearly show, our people—and our institutions—still possess the idealism, the
vitality and the basic soundness which has seen us through difficult times before
and which can make the years ahead as great as any in our history.
