Toasts of the President and Prime Minister
Pierre Elliott Trudeau of Canada. December 4, 1974
Mr. Prime Minister and gentlemen:
Let me say at the outset, we are delighted to have you as our guests. I must
say on behalf of my wife, she made a very special effort. This is the first oppor-
tunity she has had to have this room for this purpose, and she said she hoped
that you would enjoy the atmosphere and setup: And if you say yes, I will tell
her.
Let me, on a more serious note, say that we are delighted to have you here
because of our deep respect and affection for you as the leader of one of our
great friends and allies.
Let me add, if I might, that we in the United States know of no other coun-
try where the United States has some 4,000 or 5,000 miles of border, when you
consider not only the north and south but also Alaska. And so, there is a great
reason for us to have a rapport and a particular affection, people to people and
country to country.
I might say the first trip that I ever took out of the United States-I was
quite young and quite thrilledâ€”was the trip that I took from Detroit to Windsor.
[Laughter]
They didn't preclude me from going to Windsor, and I had no trouble
getting back. [Laughter]
But that was a thrill to me, and it was my first trip out of our country and to
a foreign country.
But my memories of that trip left me with a great remembrance of the rela-
tionship that our country has with yours. The truth is, of course, good friends
often have many differences, and among friends, differences fortunately can
be better debated or discussed than they can when a different relationship exists.
