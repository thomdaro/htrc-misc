Public Papers of the Presidents
No less important is the composition of the Commission. It brings together
representatives of the legislative and executive branches of the Federal Govern-
ment, representatives from State and local governments, and members from
industry and the public. All are involved in the paperwork problem in one way
or another. It is fitting that we all share the opportunity and responsibility of
reexamining our present policies and procedures and recommending new ways
to obtain more effectively the information the Government needs without
unreasonably burdening the public.
I look forward to seeing the results of the Commission's work.

Statement on Signing Legislation Establishing the Cuyahoga
Valley National Recreation Area in Ohio. December 28, 1974
I HAVE approved H.R. 7077, which establishes the Cuyahoga Valley National
Recreation Area in Ohio. The establishment of this area paves the way for the
preservation of thousands of acres of unspoiled land for the enjoyment of pres-
ent and future generations.
In signing this bill, I want to express my reservation about a provision of the
bill which authorizes the Secretary of the Interior to provide Federal police and
fire services to the area, or reimburse local agencies which perform these services.
I ask the Congress to amend this legislation to remove this provision so that
police and fire services are provided by local agencies, without reimbursement,
as in other such Federal recreational areas.
