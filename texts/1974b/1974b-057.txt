Dear Mr. Chairman:
August 16, 1974
I have your letter of August 9, and it is with great pleasure that I accept the
invitation you have extended on behalf of the Board of Governors to be the
Honorary Chairman of the American National Red Cross.
Through the years, the American Red Cross has maintained an outstanding
record of voluntary humanitarian services, fulfilling with high dedication and
skill the obligations of its Congressional Charter. In the time ahead, I look
forward to the opportunity of working with you, the Board of Governors and
the Red Cross volunteer leadership across the Nation as we continue to meet
the emergency and humanitarian needs of all our people.
With personal best wishes,
Sincerely,
GERALD R. FORD
