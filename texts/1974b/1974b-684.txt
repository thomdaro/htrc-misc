Public Papers of the Presidents
on October 21-22 with the Departments of State, Commerce and Defense and
reported that approximately $1,050 million in purchases by allies other than the
Federal Republic of Germany have been identified.
The Departments of Commerce and Defense have sought to confirm this
figure by examining the U.S. balance of payments accounts and records in an
effort to identify balance of payments receipts reflecting military-related sales and
exports to our European NATO allies, on both a government-to-government and
commercial category basis. However, this data is still incomplete and the U.S.
accounting system in many cases is too aggregated to identify all of the specific
purchases and payments made by the European members of NATO. For this
reason our calculation of the final offset total will take into account the informa-
tion being provided through the NATO Economic Directorate by our European
NATO allies. On the basis of the foregoing, I continue to expect that the require-
ments of Section 812 will be met.
