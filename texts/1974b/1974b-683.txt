Message to the Congress Reporting on the Balance of
Payments Deficit Incurred Under the North Atlantic
Treaty. November 18, 1974
To the Congress of the United States:
In accordance with Section 812(d) of the Department of Defense Appropria-
tion Authorization Act, 1974 (Public Law 93-155), I am pleased to submit a
report to the Congress on our further progress toward offsetting the balance of
payments deficit resulting from the deployment of U.S. forces in NATO Europe.
I am now able to provide you with figures for U.S. expenditures in NATO
Europe during fiscal year 1974. These figures were compiled by the Department
of Commerce in consultation with the Department of Defense and the General
Accounting Office. They indicate that in FY 74 the expenditures resulting from
the deployment of U.S. forces in fulfillment of our NATO commitments and
obligations amounted to $1,983 million (including preliminary fourth quarter
data subject to revision). Attached to this report is an appendix showing how
this figure was derived and what adjustments were made to conform our normal
expenditure data to the letter and intent of Section 812. Minor changes in this
data may occur as final quarter fiscal year 1974 figures are confirmed during the
next few weeks.
As President Nixon reported to the Congress on May 16, 1974, the offset agree-
ment concluded in April 1974 with the Federal Republic of Germany had a
dollar value of approximately $2.22 billion over fiscal years 1974 and 1975. Of
that amount, the fiscal year 1974 portion, approximating $1.1 billion, will be
directly applicable toward meeting the requirements of Section 812, leaving
approximately $883 million to be offset by our other European NATO allies.
As I noted in my report of August 20, 1974, the NATO Economic Directorate,
at the direction of the North Atlantic Council, has established a mechanism for
identifying allied purchases of military-related items from the United States.
This was an essential step to enable us to comply with the requirements of Sec-
tion 812. Representatives of the Economic Directorate consulted in Washington
