Message to the Senate Transmitting the United States-Australian
Treaty on Extradition. August 22, 1974
To the Senate of the United States:
With a view to receiving the advice and consent of the Senate to ratification, I
transmit herewith the Treaty on Extradition between the United States of
America and Australia, signed at Washington on May 14, 1974. I transmit also,
for the information of the Senate, the report of the Department of State with
respect to the Treaty.
The Treaty will, upon entry into force, terminate, as between the United
States and Australia, the Treaty on Extradition between the United States and
Great Britain of December 22, 1931, as made applicable to Australia. This new
Treaty represents a substantial modernization with respect to the procedural
aspects of extradition.
The Treaty includes in the list of extraditable offenses several which are of
prime international concern, such as aircraft hijacking, narcotics offenses, and
conspiracy to commit listed offenses.
The Treaty will make a significant contribution to the international effort
to control narcotics traffic. I recommend that the Senate give early and favorable
consideration to the Treaty and give its advice and consent to ratification.
The White House,
August 22, 1974.
GERALD R. FORD
NOTE: The text of the treaty and accompanying papers are printed in Senate Executive F (93d Cong.,
2d sess.).
