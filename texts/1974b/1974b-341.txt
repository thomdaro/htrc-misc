Telegram on State and Local Efforts To Fight Inflation.
October 14, 1974
THE NONPARTISAN voluntary Citizens' Action Committee to Fight Infla-
tion has recommended a 10-point program which I plan to pass on to the Nation
in a speech in Kansas City Tuesday evening. Two of their recommendations also
can be implemented by State and local authorities: (1) conserve energy by
enforcing the 55-mile per hour speed limit, and (2) eliminate outmoded regula-
tions that keep costs of goods and services high and enforce regulations that
advance efficiency, health, and safety.
The Committee also asked me to call upon all Governors, mayors, and other
local officials to set up similar voluntary citizens' action committees to fight
inflation in the States and communities. I urge you to assist by prompt action
on the Committee's recommendations. Thanks for your cooperation.
Warm regards,
GERALD R. FORD
NOTE: This is the text of identical telegrams sent to 54 Governors, 150 mayors, and 30 county executives.

Statement on House Action Sustaining Veto of the Continuing
Appropriations Resolution. October 15, 1974
I AM deeply gratified by the House vote sustaining my veto of the continuing
resolution. This wise and responsive action will serve the cause of peace on
Cyprus while maintaining the strength of our vital security relationships in the
Eastern Mediterranean.
I want to thank the Congressional leadership for its understanding and sup-
port. I look forward to working in partnership with the Congress to enhance the
ability of the United States to assist the parties in negotiating a peaceful and
lasting resolution of the Cyprus dispute and in responding generously to the
humanitarian relief needs of the Cypriot people. At the same time, I ask
Congress for prompt action to provide continued funding without encumbering
restrictions for the operation of several departments and agencies.
