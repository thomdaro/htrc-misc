Remarks on Boston School Desegregation Violence.
October 12, 1974
BOSTON is a fine, proud city, the cradle of liberty, where many of the free-
doms that we all so cherish today in this country, were born, 200 years ago.
The people of Boston share a tradition for reason, fairness, and respect for the
rights of others. Now, in a difficult period for all of you, it is a time to reflect on
all that your city means to you, to react in the finest tradition of your city's
people. It is up to you, every one of you, every parent, child, to reject violence
of any kind in your city, to reject hatred and the shrill voices of the violent few.
I know that nothing is more important to you than the safety of the children
in Boston. And only your calm and thoughtful action now can guarantee that
safety. I know that you will all work together for that goal, and have one more
thing to be proud of in the cradle of liberty.
NOTE: The President's remarks were recorded for use on Boston radio stations, at the request of Boston
media representatives.
