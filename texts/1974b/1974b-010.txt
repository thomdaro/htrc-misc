The items published in this volume are presented in chronological order,

speeches will find them listed in the index under â€œaddresses and remarks."
Appendixes have been provided to deal with special categories of Presidential
issuances and actions, as noted below.
White House releases not included as items in this volume and not appearing
in later appendixes are listed in Appendix A.
A complete listing by number and subject of all Proclamations, Executive
orders, and similar documents required by law to be published in the Federal
Register appears in Appendix B for the period covered by this volume.

Congress. Those transmitted during the period covered by this volume are listed
in Appendix C.
Appendix D is the condensed transcript of an interview with the President as
published in Newsweek magazine on December 9, 1974. It is printed here in
order to provide more complete coverage of the Presidency in 1974.
