Ramadan Message. October 17, 1974
ON THE occasion of the special feast days concluding Ramadan, Mrs. Ford
and I wish to extend our warmest greetings to all Americans of the Islamic
Faith.
For nearly two hundred years, our nation has derived its strength from the
diversity of its people and of their beliefs. That strength has been greatly en-
hanced by your own religious heritage.
I am sure that the completion of your month of fasting will bring home to you
more than ever the importance of religious responsibilities in daily life. Fellow
citizens of all faiths join you in this sentiment. We will be with you in spirit as
you reaffirm your commitment to principles which exalt man's existence.
May your celebration and the special message of these holy days fortify and
uplift each of you and add to our vitality as a nation.
NOTE: The text of the message was issued by the White House.

Veto of Freedom of Information Act Amendments.
October 17, 1974
To the House of Representatives:
I am returning herewith without my approval H.R. 12471, a bill to amend the
public access to documents provisions of the Administrative Procedures Act. In
August, I transmitted a letter to the conferees expressing my support for the
direction of this legislation and presenting my concern with some of its provi-
sions. Although I am gratified by the Congressional response in amending
several of these provisions, significant problems have not been resolved.
