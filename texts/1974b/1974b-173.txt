Toasts of the President and Prime Minister Rabin
of Israel. September 12, 1974
Mr. Prime Minister, Mrs. Rabin, and honored guests:
It is a great privilege and honor for Mrs. Ford and myself to be host to the two
of you on this occasion and to warmly welcome you back to the United States
in this capacity as the Prime Minister of your great country.
But I would also like to extend our warm welcome for all of your friends who
are here and the many, many friends throughout the whole United States who
are also good and firm friends of the two of you and to extend to you, represent-
ing your country, the depth and the warmth of the feeling that we in the United
States have for Israel.
As I was sitting here chatting with you and talking to Mrs. Rabin, I couldn't
help but note that 1948 was a somewhat significant year as far as your country is
concerned, and it just happened that it was quite a year as far as the Fords were
concerned. It was the year that we were married-
MRS. RABIN. And the Rabins.
THE PRESIDENT. Oh! [Laughter]â€”and the year that I got elected to Con-
gress but, more importantly, certainly, the year that Israel gained its independ-
ence.
And I am pleased to note that our country was the first of all countries in the
world at that time to recognize Israel. And we were proud to do it then, and we
are proud that it was done by America at that time.
It is especially nice to have the opportunity of meeting with you yesterday,
and today, and tonight, tomorrow, a person who is a soldier, a diplomat, and a
political leader, and to know that you represent your country so effectively and
so well.
