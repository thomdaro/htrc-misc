Public Papers of the Presidents
Tonight, I ask those who can to make it 10 percent, and I am ordering an
even larger reduction for all Federal vehicles.
A national reporting system will be instituted before this year ends to assure a
new year of less inflation and greater self-confidence for all Americans. We will
know exactly where we are going and how fast we are getting there.
As I listen and travel, I hear each day of new and exciting efforts by individ-
uals and volunteer groups in our great country. This is the real WIN spirit of
America. I am greatly encouraged. I think we are on our way.
With your help, each new day will bring more good news than bad news
for our economy. Yes, there will be some setbacks. We will not be out of the
economic trenches by Christmas. But I remind you, if I might, of just one fact:
Every battle in history has been won by the side that held on for just 5 minutes
longer. Our enemy in this battle has been called inflation. But perhaps Pogo was
wiser when he said, "I have met the enemy, and he is us."
If we, the people, can overcome ourselves as we have other enemies in our his-
tory, we will surely overcome our economic difficulties and come out a happier
and a better people.
Let me close by reading you an energy-saving suggestion of an 8-year-old girl
in Bristol, Virginia. Her name is Luette Drumheller, and here is what she
wrote: “Turn off lights when not needed, and if you are scared when you go to
bed without the light on, tell your mother or father, and they will do something
about it."
Luette, we are not going to be scared of the dark, any of us, because we are
all in this together-mothers and fathers, grandparents and great, great grand-
parents, sisters and brothers—until together, we turn back on the lights of a
brighter tomorrow in America.
Thank you very, very much.
NOTE: The President spoke at 7:05 p.m. at the Municipal Auditorium. His remarks were broadcast live on
