Statement on the Death of Walter Lippmann.
December 14, 1974
WITH the death of Walter Lippmann, we have lost a great American. As a
newsman, political analyst, and author, Walter Lippmann played a major role
for more than half a century in the development of public dialog and in shaping
a new standard of journalism.
Mr. Lippmann's contributions to the good society which he envisioned for his
country will long be remembered.
NOTE: Mr. Lippmann, 85, died in New York City.
He wrote a nationally syndicated newspaper column,
Today and Tomorrow, from 1931 to 1967, for
which he received Pulitzer Prizes in 1958 and 1962.
The statement was released at Martinique, French
West Indies.

Statement Following Senate Action on the Trade Act
of 1974. December 14, 1974
ON BEHALF of all Americans, I would like to thank the United States Senate
for approving the foreign trade bill. The House has already passed the bill. We
are especially grateful to the leaders of both parties. Thanks to their strong,
bipartisan efforts we are now in a position to launch a trade program that will
strengthen our economy and further our efforts for peace. The Senate has
demonstrated a willingness to set aside party differences when the interests of
our Nation are at stake.
With this sort of continued compromise and cooperation between the executive
and legislative branches of Government, I am more confident than ever that
working together we will continue to develop comprehensive programs to meet
all our Nation's needs.
NOTE: The bill passed the Senate on December 13,
1974, and was signed by the President on January 3,
1975, as Public Law 93-618 (88 Stat. 1978). The
statement was released at Martinique, French West
Indies.
