Public Papers of the Presidents
sit and wait until Congress acts on this-and I think they ought to act a lot more
quickly than they have-I think would be wrong.
Some things that we have to achieve here are vitally important, and I think
the trip ought to go on, and as far as I am concerned, it is.
FUTURE DIRECTION FOR THE REPUBLICAN PARTY
[16.] Q. Jennifer Schanno, College of St. Catherine in St. Paul, Minnesota.
Mr. President, there seems to be some argument as to what direction the Repub-
lican Party should go to avoid another landslide defeat. Some are saying it should
go in a moderate direction, some in a more conservative.
In which direction do you feel it should go?
The President. I think the Republican Party ought to continue to be a middle-
of-the-road party, a party that has a strong, internationally oriented foreign

I think that is a good policy, and I don't see why we should abandon a good
policy just because we took a licking on November 5.
If you go back in history, in 1946 when Mr. Truman was President, the
Democrats took a worse beating, and the 80th Congress came in with more Re-

Democrats didn't abandon their policies. They went out and fought for them.
They went out and made an effort to sell them. And Mr. Truman and the Demo-

I think that is what we ought to do as Republicans in 1976.
PARTY CONTROL OF CONGRESS
[17.] Q. Mr. President, Lester Schlangen of the Associated Press.
Why do the Democrats seem to have better luck in electing Democratic Con-
gresses than Republicans do? Why can't the Republicans do that? You haven't
won in 40 years.
THE PRESIDENT. Well, I am glad you pointed out that the Democrats have con-
trolled the Congress-the House and the Senate-38 out of the last 42 years. So, all
of the evils that you have had, you can blame on them, not on us. [Laughter]
RELATIONS WITH CONGRESS
[18.] Q. Mr. President, Forrest Boyd, Mutual Broadcasting.
I would like to take that just one step further. Senator Dole suggested that
