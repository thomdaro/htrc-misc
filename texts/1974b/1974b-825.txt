Statement on Signing Budget Rescission Legislation.
December 23, 1974
I HAVE signed H.R. 17505, a bill to rescind $131 million budget authority that
is not needed for five Federal programs. This is the first such bill to come to me
under the new provisions established by the Congressional Budget and Impound-
ment Control Act of 1974. In that respect, I take pleasure in signing this bill
because its passage demonstrates that the new procedures will work.
However, at the same time, I am dismayed that the Congress failed to in-
clude in this bill rescissions I proposed of $85 million for the so-called "REAP‚Äù
[Rural Environmental Assistance Program] program and $456 million for the
Rural Electrification Administration. By failing to include my proposals in this
bill, the Congress has, in effect, insisted that $541 million of the taxpayers money
be spent, even though there is no demonstrated need.
Instead of accepting its responsibilities as a full partner in the struggle to keep
Federal spending under control, the Congress has yielded to the pressures of spe-
cial interest constituencies and provided unneeded benefits at the expense of the
fight against inflation and the welfare of the taxpayer. For the Nation's sake,
this kind of action must not set the pattern for the future. I urge the Congress to
reconsider this matter.
NOTE: As enacted, H.R. 17505, approved December 21, 1974, is Public Law 93-529 (88 Stat. 1710). The
statement was released at Vail, Colo.

Memorandum of Disapproval of Health Revenue Sharing and
Health Services Legislation. December 23, 1974
I HAVE withheld my approval from H.R. 14214, the "Health Revenue Sharing
and Health Services Act of 1974."
H.R. 14214 conflicts with my strong commitment to the American taxpayers
