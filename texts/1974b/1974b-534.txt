Public Papers of the Presidents
And I thank all of them for taking on these new responsibilities. I think they
are an outstanding group of administrators with experience both outside of
Government and within the Government.
So, Rog, you have got a good group, and I am proud of them, and I think they
will do a first-class job. Thank you very, very much.
Well, with those preliminary announcements, I will be glad now to respond to
any questions.

23 years. Might this sort of thing prompt you to amend your economic program

are any economic factors which justify a change, I will be open to suggestions.
But at this point, I still believe the plan or program, as I submitted it, is sound,
both to meet the challenge of inflation and any deterioration in the economy.
