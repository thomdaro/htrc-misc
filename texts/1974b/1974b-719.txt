Gerald R. Ford, 1974
This cost the taxpayers $700 million. Equally discouraging was the passage by
Congress over my veto of the Railroad Retirement bill costing $285 million this
year and $7 billion over the next 25 years.
There have been some reductions in expected spending levels. The Environ-
mental Protection Agency will spend less than planned because anticipated
schedules for sewage treatment construction have not been met.
However, the most significant change is the increased aid to the jobless—
including the National Employment Assistance Act I proposed last month—-
that added $2.7 billion to the budget. This increase is necessary to ease the
burden on those who are most affected by current economic stress.
Taking these developments into account, my present recommendations for
$4.6 billion of budget reductions will result in a budget total of $299.5 billion
before considering $2.7 billion increased spending for aid to the unemployed.
These recommendations represent a major effort at budgetary restraint. It
would be unwise, in my view, to add additional dollar reductions for each
dollar of increased aid to the unemployed.
The fiscal year 1975 budget actions by the Executive and the Congress since
July 1, including those I now propose, are summarized and compared to last
year's actual expenditures as follows:

The 1975 outlay estimates can be affected significantly by variations in income
from oil lease sales on the Outer Continental Shelf. This income is treated in the
budget as an offset to spending. If the current schedule of lease sales is not met, for
environmental or other reasons, or if the bids are significantly less than antic-
ipated, outlays could further increase—possibly by $3 billion or more.
The reductions I propose to the Congress will require a number of changes in
