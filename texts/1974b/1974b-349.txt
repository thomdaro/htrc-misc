community, in every State, I will then award WIN flags to the most outstanding
as public recognition of their contribution to the fight on inflation.
Similar recognition will be given to outstanding energy savers, both individ-
uals and groups. Saving energy is, of course, a major way to save costs.
The national committee will help local groups to organize.
Committee recommendation number six: To help offset pay increases, insist
on productivity improvements where you work from the boss on down the line.
In short, work better, waste less, both of time and materials.
And there is not a place where business is done or activity is undertaken where
the boss and everyone else can't work better and save more. And we should urge
them to do it as soon as possible.
Now, Mr. and Mrs. Ed Monson write from San Antonio to urge support of

best way to get a real bargain.
Kathy Daly, a student at Sacred Heart High School in Weymouth, Massa-
chusetts, has one formula for shopping wisely and saving energy. Kathy sug-
gests buying warmer clothes this winter.
G. M. Knapp of Tucson, Arizona, puts it this way: "Only you can stop infla-
tion. Buy only if you need it."
Committee recommendation number eight asks Americans to work with
others to eliminate outmoded regulations that keep the cost of goods and services
high and to enforce regulations that advance efficiency, health, and safety.
W. A. Taylor of Cambridge, Massachusetts, points out that because of Inter-
state Commerce Commission regulations, many, many trucks return emptyâ€”
"deadheading," so to speak. I have already asked the Congress to undertake a
