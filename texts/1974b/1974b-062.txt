Remarks on Arrival at Chicago, Illinois. August 19, 1974
THIS IS a wonderful, wonderful day in Chicago, and Betty and I are deeply
grateful for all of you coming out to visit us on our first trip out of Washington
since a week or 10 days ago. Thank you so, so very much.
Now, let me just add a word, if I might. I have said it several times, but all of
you can contribute so much. We have got a lot of work to do. That includes
me as well as you and our fellow Americans. We are going to do that work,
and we are going to accomplish what has to be done, both at home and abroad.
There is, I think, a great opportunity for America, for what we can do at
home and what we can do abroad. It will take a little belt tightening and
sacrificing, but with the spirit that I know exists in America, and you exemplify
it here this morning by your warm welcome, I am sure we can do the job,
with God's help.
Thank you so very, very much.
NOTE: The President spoke at 9:30 a.m. at O'Hare Field.

Remarks to the Veterans of Foreign Wars Annual Convention,
Chicago, Illinois. August 19, 1974
Commander Ray Soden, Governor Walker, my former Members or former col-
leagues of the United States Congress, my fellow members of the Veterans of
Foreign Wars:
Let me express my deepest gratitude for your extremely warm welcome, and
may I say to Mayor Daley and to all the wonderful people of Chicago who
have done an unbelievable job in welcoming Betty and myself to Chicago, we
are most grateful.
I have a sneaking suspicion that Mayor Daley and the people of Chicago
knew that Betty was born in Chicago. Needless to say, I deeply appreciate
your medal and the citation on my first trip out of Washington as your Presi-
dent. I hope that in the months ahead I can justify your faith in making the
citation and the award available to me.
It is good to be back in Chicago, among people from all parts of our great
