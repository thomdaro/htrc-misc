Statement on Senate Action To Suspend United States -
Military Assistance to Turkey. October 1, 1974
LAST NIGHT, the Eagleton amendment to the continuing resolution author-
ity was passed by the Senate. Today, the continuing resolution itself will be
brought to a Senate vote.
It is my conviction that approval of the continuing resolution, containing the
Eagleton amendment or similar language, would destroy any hope for the suc-
cess of the initiatives the United States has already taken or may take in
the future to contribute to a just settlement of the Cyprus dispute. This view is
shared by Secretary of State Kissinger, who is now in New York where he is
making a major effort in his talks with Greek and Turkish representatives to
bring about progress.
If the Eagleton amendment or similar language is adopted by the Congress,
the United States will have lost its negotiating flexibility and influence. It thus
hurts the very countries and objectives it purports to help.
It is my intention, therefore, to withhold my consent to any continuing reso-
lution which reaches my desk containing language such as that found in the
Eagleton amendment. I can, however, accept, and indeed endorse, the language
