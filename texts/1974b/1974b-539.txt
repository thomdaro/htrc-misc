Gerald R. Ford, 1974
dents in the past in the executive branch of the Government. It is my judgment
that he would be a very good Vice President. And therefore, these disclosures
indicate that he does believe in helping his friends. And a man of that wealth
certainly, in my judgment, has that right to give as long as the law is obeyed,
and as I understand it, he has.
It seems to me that his qualifications from previous public service fully qualify

THE 25TH AMENDMENT
[12.] Q. Mr. President, as the only living veteran of the 25th amendment,

that term to our economic condition now?
THE PRESIDENT. Recession has been defined. I think the national bureau of

this matter. It is my understanding they are going to come up with some answer
on this question in the very near future.
But let me make an observation of my own, if I might. We are facing some dif-
ficult economic circumstances. We have too many people unemployed, and we
want to do something about it. And my economic package that I submitted to the
Congress and the American people will do something about it.
The American people are concerned about inflation, and my economic pro-
gram would do something about inflation. So, what we have tried to do, instead
