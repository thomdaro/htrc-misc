The President's News Conference of
October 9, 1974
THE PRESIDENT. I never promised you a rose garden, but I guess Ron Nessen did.
So, I hope you enjoy this new setting and the new format, and I hope I enjoy it,
too.
MEETING WITH PRESIDENT ECHEVERRÍA
[1.] I do have one business announcement. I am pleased to announce this
afternoon that President Echeverría of Mexico and I have agreed to hold a meet-
ing on the U.S.-Mexican border on Monday, October 21.
I am very much looking forward to this opportunity to meet with President
Echeverría in the Nogales area, and we plan to visit both sides of the border. The
United States and Mexico have a long tradition of friendly and cooperative re-
lations. It is my hope that our meeting will contribute to maintaining that
relationship and to strengthen the good will between our countries over the
years to come.
At this meeting, we will discuss, obviously, a wide range of subjects of interest
to both countries.
One of the first responses to our WIN program yesterday was John Osborne's ¹
signing up, and I have his application right here. Thank you, John.
Well, the first question. Dick Lerner [Richard E. Lerner, United Press
International].
QUESTIONS
INFLATION AND RECESSION
[2.] Q. Mr. President, a few things were left unsaid in your economic
address yesterday. I was wondering if you could say now if the United States
is in a recession, and how soon Americans can expect to see a meaningful reduc-
tion of inflation and unemployment?
THE PRESIDENT. I do not think the United States is in a recession. We do have
economic problems, but it is a very mixed situation, and that was the reason that
we had some 31 specific recommendations in my speech yesterday.
We have to be very, very careful to make sure that we don't tighten the screws
