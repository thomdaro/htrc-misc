Message to the Congress Reporting on the Balance of
Payments Deficit Incurred Under the North Atlantic
Treaty. August 20, 1974
To the Congress of the United States:
In accordance with Section 812(d) of the Department of Defense Appropria-
tion Authorization Act, 1974 (Public Law 93â€“155), I am pleased to submit a
report to Congress on our progress toward offsetting the balance of payments
deficit resulting from the deployment of U.S. forces in NATO Europe.
President Nixon reported to the Congress on May 16, 1974 that the offset agree-
ment concluded in April 1974 with the Federal Republic of Germany had a dol-
lar value of approximately $2.22 billion over fiscal years 1974 and 1975. Of that
amount, the fiscal year 1974 portion will total approximately $1.1 billion and
will be directly applicable toward meeting the requirements of Section 812.
Since President Nixon's last report, the NATO Economic Directorate has
concluded a study showing the payments for military-related items from the
United States by allies other than the Federal Republic of Germany should
amount to approximately $1 billion. When the amount is added to the fiscal year
1974 portion of the offset agreement with Germany, it becomes clear that the
United States should be able to offset the $2.1 billion military foreign exchange
expenditures resulting from the deployment of our forces in NATO Europe
during fiscal year 1974. Accordingly, I can report to the Congress that the
requirements of Section 812 should be met.
The White House,
August 20, 1974.
