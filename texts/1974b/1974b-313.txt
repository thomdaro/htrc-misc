Message to the Congress Transmitting Annual Report of the
National Advisory Council on Extension and Continuing
Education. October 10, 1974
To the Congress of the United States:
I herewith transmit the Eighth Annual Report of the National Advisory Coun-
cil on Extension and Continuing Education. The Council is authorized by Public
Law 89-329.
The Council again this year points to the problems caused by the multiplicity
of legislative authorities, funding mechanisms, and responsible departments
and agencies involved in the programs it has studied. While I cannot agree with
all of the specific program recommendations contained in the Council's eighth
report, I would call your attention to the members' support for the objectives
and purposes of revenue sharing.
I share the Council's concern on the mechanics of decisionmaking under
special revenue sharing. It is of vital importance that legislation be enacted
which permits State and local determinations to prevail.
Policymakers at the State and local level are most capable of making decisions
which respond to the needs of the people. At the same time, organizations with
broad mandates such as the National Foundation on the Arts and the Humani-
ties and the Fund for the Improvement of Postsecondary Education will
continue their support of diverse projects in many areas of social, cultural, and
educational concern.
The White House,
October 10, 1974.
GERALD R. FORD
NOTE: The 53-page report is entitled "The Importance of Service: Federal Support for Continuing
Education."
