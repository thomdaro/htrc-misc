The data base of the National Fire Data Center will assist States and com-
munities in setting priorities and in identifying possible solutions to problems.
It will monitor the progress of the Nation in reducing fire losses.
The bill contains a provision that requires the Secretary of Health, Education,
and Welfare to establish 25 burn treatment centers, 90 burn programs, and 25
centers for expanded research on burns. Since these centers would duplicate the
burn research carried on through the trauma program of the National Institute
of General Medical Sciences and would add $5 million to the FY 75 budget, I
will not seek appropriations to implement this particular provision of the bill.
NOTE: As enacted, S. 1767, approved October 29, 1974, is Public Law 93-498 (88 Stat. 1535).

Statement on Signing Indian Claims Commission
Appropriations Legislation. October 29, 1974
I HAVE signed S. 3007, an act to authorize appropriations for the Indian Claims
Commission for 1975.
It is a particular pleasure for me to be able to sign this bill because there are
not many opportunities in life to take clear and decisive action designed to right
a past wrong.
The background is this:
In 1877, the United States Government took over lands from the Sioux Indians
in the Black Hills of South Dakota. At the same time, to prevent widespread
starvation of these Indians deprived of their hunting grounds, the Government
supplied them with food and other provisions for a number of years.
Earlier this year, the Indian Claims Commission ruled that the United States
took the Black Hills lands illegally in violation of the fifth amendment. The
1877 value of the land and gold was estimated at $17.5 million which, together
with interest from that point, boosts the value today to nearly $103 million.
However, the Indian Claims Commission Act of 1946 contains a provision
requiring that the Government-supplied food and other provisions, valued at
approximately $57 million, be used to offset the Indians' claims against the
Government. If this offsetting provision stayed in effect, it would totally wipe
out the $17.5 million original evaluation and leave the Sioux Indians with
nothing.
