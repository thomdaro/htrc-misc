in many social programs, and I think he has a
reputation and the leadership capability.
I want him to be very active in the Domestic
Council, even to the extent of being chairman of
the Domestic Council. I do think we have to have
some real leadership and strength there, and I think
he is peculiarly equipped for that responsibility.
Q. Do you expect him to be helpful in attracting
new and good people into the Administration?
A. I think he can be very helpful. You know, he
has always had good people. At least I think he has.
He has attracted them, I think, because of his
personality and the dedication he has to the job, and
I think we can get more good people with him
here. He has many, many connections, of course,
over the years, academic, business, financial. I think
his presence here will help to draw people.
Thank you, Mr. President.
