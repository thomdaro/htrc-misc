with such a move, and might those plans include a possible change in our
relations over there, either with Israel or the PLO [Palestine Liberation
Organization]?
THE PRESIDENT. Our plans are aimed at trying to get the Israelis to negotiate
a settlement or additional settlements with the Egyptians and the other Arab
nations. Those are the plans we have which are affirmative and plans that I
think, if we continue constructively, can bring about some success.
Until we have failed, and I don't think we will, in trying to get the parties to
work together, I don't think it is appropriate to discuss what we will do if we
don't achieve success.
Q. Are you suggesting, Mr. President, that Israel should deal directly with the
PLO? It has been the Israeli objection all along against recognizing the PLO as
a bona fide political organization.

negotiate with the PLO. We are not a party to any negotiations. I think we have
to let the decision as to who will negotiate to be the responsibility of the parties
involved.

meetings, I think 12 all over the country, with two in Washington; and the
formulation of a good, sound economic plan that meets the problems of a
weakening economy and inflation.
I believe that we have laid additional groundwork for success in the Middle
East. We have redirected some of our policies in the subcontinent areas. We
have, in addition, enhanced the possibility of strategic arms limitation agree-
ment number two, which I think will be enhanced by the meeting I am going
to have in Vladivostok in about 12 days, hopefully to be followed by a meeting
in Washington some time in the summer of 1975.
Some of the disappointmentsâ€”we had a few bad breaks. I think the Congress
was dead wrong when they handicapped myself and Secretary Kissinger in the
efforts that we could make in the settlement of the Cyprus question between
Greece and Turkey. I think that was a terrible disappointment, and some of the
