Veto of Animal Health Research Legislation. August 15, 1974
To the House of Representatives:
I am returning today without my approval H.R. 11873, an act authorizing
the Secretary of Agriculture to encourage and assist States in carrying out
programs of animal health research.
I believe, as do proponents of this bill, that veterinary research has helped
to make American livestock the healthiest and most productive in the world.
We must continue to maintain high standards of research.
But I also believe that this bill adds little to the existing programs of the De-
partment of Agriculture and other agencies.
We are presently spending over $40 million on programs involving ani-
mal health research, and nearly every land grant college and colleges of
veterinary medicine in the United States is participating in these programs.
This bill, however, would establish a new categorical grant program that
would authorize an expenditure of an additional $47 million annually and
would be duplicative of many programs that already exist. The overlapping
would be especially true of programs in fish and shellfish research and predator
control.
Because this bill would add further to the Federal taxpayers' burdens without
significantly meeting national needs and would only add to inflationary
pressures within the economy, I feel that I must withhold my approval.
The White House,
August 14, 1974.
NOTE: The text of the veto message was released August 15, 1974.
