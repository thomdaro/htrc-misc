The President's News Conference of
September 16, 1974
The President. Ladies and gentlemen, this press conference is being held at a
time when many Americans are observing the Jewish religious New Year. It
begins a period of self-examination and reconciliation. In opening this press
conference, I am mindful that the spirit of this holy day has a meaning for all
Americans.
In examining one's deeds of the last year and in assuming responsibility for
past actions and personal decisions, one can reach a point of growth and change.
The purpose of looking back is to go forward with a new and enlightened
dedication to our highest values.
The record of the past year does not have to be endlessly relived, but can be
transformed by commitment to new insights and new actions in the year to
come.
Ladies and gentlemen, I am ready for your questions.
Mr. Cormier [Frank Cormier, Associated Press].
QUESTIONS
PARDON FOR FORMER PRESIDENT NIXON
[1.] Q. Mr. President, some Congressional Republicans who have talked to
you have hinted that you may have had a secret reason for granting President
Nixon a pardon sooner than you indicated you would at the last news conference,
and I wonder if you could tell us what that reason was?
