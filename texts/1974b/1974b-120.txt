Statement on Signing Youth Conservation Corps Legislation.
September 3, 1974
I AM signing today S. 1871 which amends the Youth Conservation Corps Act of
1970.
The Youth Conservation Corps program provides summer work-education
experiences for young people aged 15 through 18, of all income classes, on Fed-
eral lands administered by the Departments of Interior and Agriculture. This
year, most of the States and territories established YCC programs on State lands
under a pilot grant program.
This act establishes a program to expand the participation of young people
in activities on Federal and State lands. It makes the State grant program per-
manent. It also would permit use of Corps members on projects on Federal
lands administered in other Federal agencies.
Though I have some concerns about the cost of this program at a time when
inflation is our number one domestic problem, this act is not inconsistent with
the 1975 budget, and thus I am pleased to be able to sign it.
NOTE: As enacted, S. 1871, approved September 3, 1974, is Public Law 93-408 (88 Stat. 1066).

Remarks on Signing a National Hispanic Heritage Week
Proclamation. September 4, 1974
LET ME sign this declaration or proclamation, and then I will make sure that
you all get a pen, Joe.
In 1968, the Congress passed a resolution [H.J. Res. 1299] which provided for
the recognition of Hispanic Americans, that we should have a week once a year
where their contribution to the American society would be fully appreciated
and totally recognized.
This week begins on September 10 and runs through the 17th [16th], and this
proclamation is predicated on that resolution which was approved 6 years ago.
It is a pleasure for me to be in the company of the Members of Congress who
are here, and I understand that Congressman Manuel Lujan is flying in from
New Mexico but will be a few minutes late, but he will be joining us very
shortly.
