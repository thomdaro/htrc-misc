Message to the Congress Transmitting Annual Report of the
National Capital Housing Authority. November 13, 1974
To the Congress of the United States:
I am herewith transmitting the National Capital Housing Authority's annual
report for the fiscal year ending June 30, 1973. The report sets forth the efforts of
the Authority to improve and expand the housing opportunities in the District
of Columbia.
In light of the recent transfer of the National Capital Housing Authority to
the District of Columbia Government, I hope that even greater efforts will be
made to improve housing conditions in the Nation's Capital.
The White House,
November 13, 1974.
GERALD R. FORD
NOTE: The report is entitled "Public Housing in Transition, National Capital Housing Authority Annual
Report-1973" (Government Printing Office, 36 pp.).

Remarks on Signing the WIN Consumer Pledge.
November 13, 1974
BEFORE SIGNING, I would like to read a statement that has been prepared:
Mrs. Ford and I are signing today the first consumer pledge prepared for
Americans by the nonpartisan Citizens' [Action] Committee to Fight Inflation.
The WIN committee is asking mayors and principal county officials across
this country to set up local action committees for distribution in the near future
of similar pledges for citizens to sign in a concerted mass effort to stop inflation.
The committee has also prepared a businessman, and businesswoman's pledge
and a worker's pledge for local distribution. Each Governor is being asked to
establish one statewide committee to determine ways and means to slow inflation
and to save energy in each State.
If all Americans will pull together to hold down prices, to buy wisely, to
increase productivity, and to save energy, this citizens' mobilization to slow in-
flation can and will work. Inflation is sapping the economic strength of this
country, and it must be brought under control.
