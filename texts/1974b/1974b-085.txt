Finally, S. 3066 authorizes a more flexible approach to assisting low- and
moderate-income families obtain adequate housing. This new lower income

areas where vacancies are unreasonably low.
No one expects this bill to bring substantial immediate relief to the housing
market, but over the long haul it should provide the foundations for better
housing for all Americans.

Like any omnibus bill, S. 3066 has minuses as well as pluses. But it is the
product of significant cooperation and compromise by the legislative and
executive branches of this Government, and, as such, it is an important example
of how the Congress and I intend to approach the Nation's problems in the
future.

administrative burdens are not by themselves sufficient obstacles to prevent
progress in Government, and I will therefore not comment on those aspects of
the bill.
There are, however, more significant costs to Government that would be
exacted by this billâ€”not in dollar terms, but relating more fundamentally to
the way Government, and the Executive branch in particular, has and must
