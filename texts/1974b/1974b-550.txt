other executive branch agencies and identifying potential conflicts with other
existing legislation in this field. Thus, it could seriously hamper efforts to
achieve a coherent Administration legislative program. Therefore, I am asking
the Congress to amend the law by deleting section 111. This would preserve the
executive branch's ability to develop a coordinated and coherent legislative pro-
gram.
This bill includes a number of provisions which could more appropriately be
considered in the framework of a larger, more comprehensive approach to
strengthening this country's financial system. As a result, I will continue to press
hard for Congressional passage of S. 2591, the financial institutions act, which
seeks to accomplish such a strengthening through reducing, rather than in-
creasing or perpetuating, the extent of Government control over financial in-
stitutions.
NOTE: As enacted, H.R. 11221, approved October 28, 1974, is Public Law 93-495 (88 Stat. 1500).

Statement on Signing the Amtrak Improvement Act
of 1974. October 29, 1974
I HAVE signed H.R. 15427, the Amtrak Improvement Act of 1974. However,
I believe that one provision of this act is undesirable. I refer to the section which
requires mandatory customs inspection aboard trains operated in the interna-
tional intercity rail passenger service.
This provision would adversely affect the interdiction of the flow of narcot-
ics and other contraband at ports of entry. Onboard customs inspection is in-
consistent with effective enforcement of customs laws and not always practical.
There must be flexibility in determining when and where onboard inspection is
to be conducted. Moreover, the requirement for onboard inspection on trains
could result in requests for similar treatment aboard airlines and ocean vessels.
I request that the Congress take action to revise the provision to provide for
customs inspection consistent with the effective enforcement of the customs and
related laws.
NOTE: As enacted, H.R. 15427, approved October 28, 1974, is Public Law 93-496 (88 Stat. 1526).
