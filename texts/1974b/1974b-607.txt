Gerald R. Ford, 1974
nants of the dead past. But OMSI, as I understand it, is an example of how
alive, how useful, how exciting a great museum can be, and I congratulate you for
it.
As I look around this room and see some of the younger generation, those in
the middle group-[laughter]—and some of us, some of you my age, I cannot
help but think that the people make a State and the people make a country. And
actually, Oregon is a symbol with this project and what you do in many other
fields: a great State with a proud history, but even more importantly, a promis-
ing future.
I am grateful for your invitation, I am deeply indebted to you for the oppor-
tunity to be here. And I especially am grateful for Bob Packwood's very kind
introduction. Thank you very much.
NOTE: The President spoke at 8:55 p.m. at the Memorial Coliseum.

Remarks at an Urban League Dance in Portland.
November 1, 1974
I AM HERE with Bob Packwood to participate in a very small way in a great
cause, which is the Urban League. I belong to it. We have a great Urban League
in my hometown, and the head of that in Grand Rapids is Paul Phillips. Some of
you may know him—a very dear friend of mine.
It is just wonderful to be here with Hazel and all of you. I did not come to
make a speech. I came to say hello and meet some of you and enjoy myself.
We have had a great, great day in Portland. It has been long but wonderful,
and this is sort of a climax. And I thank you for your warm, warm welcome.
You might be interested—I saw the last half of the Trail Blazers and the
Braves. The Trail Blazers won 109 to 102 (113 to 106).
NOTE: The President spoke at 10:30 p.m. at the
Masonic Temple. The Urban League sponsored the
dance for the benefit of the Albina Human Resources
Center in Portland.
