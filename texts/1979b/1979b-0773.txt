Administration of Jimmy Carter, 1979
Oct. 13
We have just called, and on the line
with us now, a 10-year-old named Shanie
Ridge in Colorado Springs, Colorado.
Shanie, are you there? Go ahead. The
President's on the line with you.
VIEWS ON THE PRESIDENCY
MISS RIDGE. Mr. Carter?
THE PRESIDENT. Yes, Shanie.
MISS RIDGE. Do you like your job?
THE PRESIDENT. Yes, I like it very
much. I like the White House and the
life there; so does Amy, by the way. And I
like my job. It's the best job in the greatest
country on Earth.
MISS RIDGE. That's what you think?
THE PRESIDENT. That's what I think.
Would you like to be President some day?
MISS RIDGE. Oh, I don't know, I
guess so.
THE PRESIDENT. Well, good. You
might have to run against Amy; I don't
know.
INFLATION
MISS RIDGE. And my other question is,
what could I do to help stop inflation?
THE PRESIDENT. I don't know if you've
been listening to the program or not,
Shanie, but I think one of the things is
that you could help to save energy, and
around the house you could observe ways
to keep doors closed, to make your parents
insulate their home better to prevent heat
from escaping. You could keep the
thermostat set fairly high during the sum-
mer and low during the winter so you
don't waste heat. You could cut off electric
lights and other electrical appliances
when they're not in use.
And when you're driving along the
road with your parents, you could cer-
tainly make sure they obey the speed
limit. And I think that when your father
or your mother go to work, for instance,
you could try to get them to join in a
carpool so that one automobile could be
filled before it rides up and down the
highways with just one person in it.
We're doing all we can on this end, but
there are a lot of things that a 10-year-old
can do. Around the school, you ought to
get together with other kids in your class,
for instance, and try to share ideas with
each other about what you can do in ad-
dition to those things that I've already
described.
if
As far as buying things is concerned,
price too much or if your mother sees
you see a product that's going up in
one going up in price, shop around and
try to get lower priced products that give
you the same service, like food or clothing
and so forth. Good shopping, I think, will
also help to control inflation.
I wish you well. It's really good to see
a 10-year-old interested in public affairs.
And you can help me as much as anyone
in this country can to cut down on energy
waste and hold down inflation.
Ms. STAMBERG. Thank you, Shanie, for
your question.
Mr. President, the next caller is
Michael Del Coro, and he's calling from
the Bronx, New York. Go ahead, Mr. Del
Coro.
SOLAR ENERGY
MR. DEL CORO. Hello, Mr. President.
THE PRESIDENT. Yes, Michael.
MR. DEL CORO. I'd like to ask you, do
you believe in solar energy?
MS. STAMBERG. Mr. Del Coro, would
you say your question again, please? We
didn't understand you.
MR. DEL CORO. Do you believe in solar
energy?
THE PRESIDENT. Solar energy-yes,
very much so. I think people forget how
much solar energy we already use. A great
1895
