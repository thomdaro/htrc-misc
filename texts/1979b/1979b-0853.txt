Digest of Other
White House Announcements
The following listing includes the
President's public schedule and other
items of general interest announced by
the White House Press Office and not
included elsewhere in this issue.
October 13
The President met at the White House
with David L. Aaron, Deputy Assistant
to the President for National Security
Affairs.
In response to inquiries on the October
12 House of Representatives gasoline de-
control vote, the White House announced
that it has been the President's policy
since the beginning of the administration
that gasoline ultimately should be decon-
trolled. The President made a decision
earlier this year based upon an assessment
of general gasoline and economic condi-
tions that decontrol would not be appro-
priate at this time. The administration
does not support a congressional amend-
ment mandating decontrol of gasoline.
The President now has all the authority
he needs to take this step when it is ap-
propriate after a review of prevailing
economic factors.
