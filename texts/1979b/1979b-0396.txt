JIMMY CARTER
Death of Samuel I. Newhouse
Statement by the President. August 29, 1979
With the death of Samuel I. Newhouse,
this country has lost a dedicated and en-
terprising publisher whose work in the
business of news spanned most of his 84
years.
He was born in a tenement to parents
who were immigrants to this country, but
created one of the largest publishing and
communications organizations in the
United States. He exemplified those quali-
ties which make this country great.
Rosalynn and I extend our sympathies
to his wife and the other members of his
family.
Columbus Day, 1979
Proclamation 4676. August 29, 1979
By the President of the United States
of America
A Proclamation
Four hundred and eighty-seven years
have passed since an Italian navigator in
the service of Spain left the Old World to
find the New. Christopher Columbus was
determined to test an audacious theory:
to reach the East, sail west. On the morn-
ing of October 12, 1492, with ninety men
in three small ships, he sailed into immor-
tality.
The voyage of this intrepid explorer
marked the convergence of American and
world history. His discovery opened a new
age an age that gave the world a new
center.
We are the inheritors of Columbus'
legacy. As a nation which has always
striven for the same qualities as the Great
Navigator, we must continue the search
for new horizons.
It is fitting that, on the observance of
this October 12, we once again recall to
mind Columbus' extraordinary voyage
and, in the spirit of that undertaking, re-
dedicate ourselves to that which is best
and most courageous in us.
In tribute to Columbus' achievement,
the Congress of the United States of
America, by joint resolution approved
April 30, 1934 (48 Stat. 657), as modified
by the Act of June 28, 1968 (82 Stat. 250),
requested the President to proclaim the
second Monday in October of each year as
Columbus Day.
Now, THEREFORE, I, JIMMY CARTER,
President of the United States of America,
do hereby designate Monday, October 8,
1979, as Columbus Day; and I invite the
people of this Nation to observe that day
in schools, churches, and other suitable
places with appropriate ceremonies in his
honor.
I also direct that the flag of the United
States of America be displayed on all
public buildings on the appointed day in
memory of Christopher Columbus.
IN WITNESS WHEREOF, I have hereun-
to set my hand this twenty-ninth day of
August, in the year of our Lord nineteen
1526
