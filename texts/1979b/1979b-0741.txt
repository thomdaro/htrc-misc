Administration of Jimmy Carter, 1979
Oct. 11
I don't see any deleterious consequences
of open debate and sharp expressions of
opinion even when they differ. I think
that the more American people are in-
volved in the evolution of decisions and
the establishment of policies for our coun-
try, domestically or foreign, the less likely
we are to make a serious mistake.
We've made some serious mistakes in
recent years with Vietnam and Watergate
and CIA violations of the law and so
forth, because the American people were
Thank you again. If you don't mind,
I'd like to get an individual photograph
with each of you before you leave. And
I'll stand right over here, and if you'll
come by, we'll just take a handshake.

So, I feel that that's part of my respon-
sibility, to correct past mistakes, to deal
fairly with the American people, and to
prevent future mistakes. And I think the
political campaign season is a good oppor-
tunity for that.
Let me say in closing that I've appre-
ciated the chance to talk to you. By the
way, we do get a very good coverage from
these editors meetings in the national news
media. There is hardly a Saturday eve-
ning or a Sunday that goes by that two or
three items, sometimes front-page stories,
don't come out of this session. We make a
transcript of all my answers. The ques-
tions are quite often probing and different
kinds of questions, and we give you I

most effective and distinguished mayors in
the city, David Rusk. David celebrated

It's good for me to come back to be with

friendship that you've always extended to
me, which is typical of the hospitality and
the character of those of you who live in
this beautiful State.
I do have a lot of responsibilities on my
shoulders, but it's one of the most chal-
lenging and, certainly, the most exciting
jobs on Earth. And it's one that I am
thinking very seriously about keeping for
a while if you'll help me. [Laughter]
This past week, we had an experience
that I think will live in the history of our
Nation and in the memories of all Amer-
icans and I'm glad that Archbishop
