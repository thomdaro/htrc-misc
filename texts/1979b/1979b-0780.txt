Administration of Jimmy Carter, 1979
help you and me and all your customers
and people like them throughout the
country.
It's been slow in coming, but we're
now making some progress. It's not really
fair to blame the Department of Energy,
because they don't have the authority to
control energy prices charged by foreign
countries. We've just got to do what I've
just told you as the best way to deal with
this problem.
MR. WINDHAM. Mr. President, I would
like to congratulate you and the Congress
on the move that you have put forth to
help these needy people in this crisis we're
in, because I feel that that is one answer,
and you're to be congratulated on that
move.
THE PRESIDENT. Thank you. This will
amount, by the way, I think, between
$100 and $200 per family, to help them
with the fuel bills this winter. So, if they
combine that help, if they're a poor fam-
ily, with saving as much energy as pos-
sible, I think we can get people through
the winter.
MR. WINDHAM. Thank you.
THE PRESIDENT. Good luck, Lew, and
thank you.
MS. STAMBERG. Thank you, Mr.
Windham.
The next call is from Lancaster, Ken-
tucky, Mr. Carter, Mr. President Carter,
and it's from Robert Gordon. Go ahead,
Mr. Gordon, you're on the line with Pres-
ident Carter.
SUGGESTION FOR PRESIDENTIAL CAMPAIGN
MR. GORDON. Yes, Mr. President. Well,
first off, I'd just like to say I love you very
much. I'm praying for you, and my
friends are praying for you.
THE PRESIDENT. Thank you.
MR. GORDON. You've got quite a re-
sponsibility. May I make a suggestion,
Mr. President?
THE PRESIDENT. Please.
MR. GORDON. Well, what I would like
to just suggest and encourage, sir, is that
when politicking time comes, cut that
time in half and spend it on your knees
seeking the Lord Jesus Christ, because, sir,
Jesus is more important than this coun-
try. He will give you the answers, sir. He
will give you the answers to lead, as it is
His will-excuse me, I'm a little nervous.
THE PRESIDENT. That's all right.
MR. GORDON. But the Lord Jesus that
puts a man in power-and if you spend
your time on your knees, seeking His will,
and if it's His will that you stay in power
another 4 years, then He'll put you in
power.
Mr. President, again, I'm praying for
you. I love you. And this is going to seem
a little silly, but I was wondering if you
could send me your autograph, sir.
THE PRESIDENT. Yes, I'll be glad to.
I'll do that.
Ms. STAMBERG. Thank you very
much.
THE PRESIDENT. Good luck, and thank
you for those good wishes and advice.
MS. STAMBERG. The next question
comes, Mr. President, from Mrs. Colleen
Porter, and she is joining us from Provo,
Utah. Go ahead, Mrs. Porter.
GOVERNMENT-SPONSORED DAY-CARE
CENTERS
MRS. PORTER. Yes. I'm married, and
I'm a full-time mother. We've got two
children, and we hope to have a few
more. And I really love my job, and I'm
concerned about the prospect of Govern-
ment-sponsored day-care centers, because
it seems to me it's logical that the in-
creased taxation necessary to keep these
running would force our economy into
even more of a two-income economy-
and there's us on our one-income budg-
et-and force me to work. And that's not
really far-fetched, because I think you
