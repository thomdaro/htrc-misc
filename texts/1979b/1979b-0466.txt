Sept. 3
Administration of Jimmy Carter, 1979
fight those battles and join those struggles,
because you know that it'll make our Na-
tion even greater. And as President of a
wonderful country, we wanted to have,
Rosalynn and I, this picnic just to express
the thanks of a grateful nation to you.
Thank you and God bless you.
Now I know you're all going to enjoy
hearing Stephen Wade, a fine young man,
give us some entertainment, part of which
is about Mark Twain and Huckleberry
Finn or Tom Sawyer. I haven't seen it
yet, but I hear he is really great, and we're
all delighted to have him. Stephen Wade.
Thank you very much. Have a good
time.
NOTE: The President spoke at 7:30 p.m. on
the South Lawn of the White House to repre-
sentatives of labor organizations.
