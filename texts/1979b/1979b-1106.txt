Dec. 11
Administration of Jimmy Carter, 1979
Act), require that the President proclaim
a) limitations on the quantity of types of
cheese specified therein which may enter
the United States in any calendar year
after 1979 to an annual aggregate quan-
tity of not more than 111,000 metric tons
and b) increases in a specified manner, of
the quantity of chocolate crumb now sub-
ject to certain import quotas which may
be entered in any calendar year after
1979. Such limitations and increases are
required to become effective on Janu-
ary 1, 1980.
It is provided in Sections 701 and 703
of the Act that such proclamation shall be
considered a proclamation issued under
Section 22 and which meets the require-
ments of such section.
The Act also approved bilateral agree-
ments entered into during the Multilat-
eral Trade Negotiations (MTN) by the
United States and certain foreign coun-
tries with respect to the quantity of cheese
and chocolate crumb subject to such limi-
tations that may be imported from such
countries. These agreements contained
the provision that "the United States
agrees to take all necessary measures to
permit the maximum utilization of the
quotas."
On the basis of the information sub-
mitted to me, I find and declare that the
import limitations hereinafter proclaimed
with respect to cheese and chocolate
crumb are in accord with the require-
ments of Sections 701 and 703 of the Act
and the bilateral agreements approved by
such Act which were entered into by the
United States and certain foreign coun-
tries with respect to the quantity of cheese
and chocolate crumb subject to such limi-
tations that may be imported from such
countries.
Now, THEREFORE, I, JIMMY CARTER,
President of the United States of Amer-
ica, acting under and by virtue of the
authority vested in me as President, and
in conformity with the provisions of Sec-
tion 22 of the Agricultural Adjustment
Act of 1933, as amended, the Tariff Clas-
sification Act of 1962, the Trade Act of
1974, the Trade Agreements Act of 1979,
and the bilateral agreements relating to
cheese and chocolate crumb approved by
the Trade Agreements Act of 1979, do
hereby proclaim that Part 3 of the Appen-
dix to the Tariff Schedules of the United
States is amended, effective January 1,
1980, as set forth in the Annex to this
proclamation.
IN WITNESS WHEREOF, I have here-
unto set my hand this eleventh day of
December, in the year of our Lord nine-
teen hundred and seventy-nine, and of
the Independence of the United States of
America the two hundred and fourth.
JIMMY CARTER
