Administration of Jimmy Carter, 1979
July 10
crude oil production has resulted in a na-
tional energy supply shortage constituting
a severe energy supply interruption as de-
fined in Section 3(8) of the Energy Policy
and Conservation Act (42 U.S.C. 6202
(8)). The Secretary based his conclusion
on the fact that current and projected im-
ports of crude oil and petroleum prod-
ucts, plus available stocks, are not
adequate to meet normal demand and
that shortages of essential fuels have be-
gun to have a major adverse impact on
the economy with the possibility of more
severe impacts occurring in the future.
Recent shortages of gasoline in some areas
of the Nation and the current inadequate
levels of heating oil stocks have under-
scored the seriousness of the situation and
demonstrate that action must be taken
now to conserve available supplies of
petroleum.
On the basis of the Secretary's report,
and other information available to me, I
hereby find and determine, in accordance
with Sections 201(b) and 3(8) of the
Energy Policy and Conservation Act (42
U.S.C. 6261 (b), 6202 (8)), the existence
of a national energy supply shortage con-
stituting a severe energy supply interrup-
tion, which:
(A) is of significant scope and dura-
tion and of an emergency nature;
(B) may cause major adverse impact
on national safety or the national
economy; and
(C) has resulted from an interruption
in the supply of imported petro-
leum products.
I further find that implementation of
the Emergency Building Temperature Re-
strictions, Energy Conservation Contin-
gency Plan No. 2, is required by the severe
energy supply interruption. This Plan was
transmitted by me to the Congress on
March 1, 1979, and approved by a resolu-
tion of each House (S. Res. 122, 125
Cong. Rec. S 5135 (May 2, 1979);
H. Res. 209, 125 Cong. Rec. H 3018
May 10, 1979)), which resolutions have
been transmitted to me by the Secretary
of the Senate and the Clerk of the House.
Those resolutions were received by me on
May 4 and May 15, 1979, respectively.
NOW, THEREFORE, I, JIMMY CARTER,
President of the United States of America,
by the authority vested in me by the Con-
stitution and laws of the United States,
including Section 201(b) of the Energy
Policy and Conservation Act (42 U.S.C.
6261 (b)), do hereby proclaim that:
SECTION 1. A severe energy supply in-
terruption, as defined in Section 3(8) of
the Energy Policy and Conservation Act
(42 U.S.C. 6202 (8)) currently exists with
respect to the supply of imported crude oil
and petroleum products.
SEC. 2. This finding shall be immedi-
ately transmitted to the Congress.
SEC. 3. The provisions of the Emer-
gency Building Temperature Restrictions,
Energy Conservation Contingency Plan
No. 2 (44 FR 12911 of March 8, 1979),
shall become effective as of July 16, 1979.
SEC. 4. In accordance with the provi-
sions of the Plan, the Secretary of Energy
is hereby authorized to issue regulations
for the purpose of implementing the En-
ergy Conservation Contingency Plan No.
2 and to administer the program in all
respects.
IN WITNESS WHEREOF, I have here-
unto set my hand this tenth day of July,
in the year of our Lord nineteen hundred
seventy-nine, and of the Independence of
the United States of America the two hun-
dred and fourth.
JIMMY CARTER
