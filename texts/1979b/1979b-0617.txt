Administration of Jimmy Carter, 1979
Sept. 25
THE PRESIDENT. My name is Jimmy
Carter. I'm President of the United
States. [Laughter]
Q. I am a fan of yours, and I was told
to tell you this.
THE PRESIDENT. I know. Great.
Q. Mr. President, welcome to New
York City.
THE PRESIDENT. And I grow peanuts,
you know, so eat peanut butter. [Laughter]
Q. Welcome to New York City, Mr.
President. You look great. There are
many millions here who stand firmly be-
hind you and who look forward to your
reelection.
My question is friendly and personal.
I wonder if you'd take a couple of min-
utes to tell us about your jogging habits
and how you are feeling in general since
your race in Maryland last week?
[Laughter]
THE PRESIDENT. I'd like to answer all
the questions, including this one. Thank
you, Mr. Gray, for your welcome.
I've been running in college. I've been
running for the State Senate, and then
for Governor, and then for President-
[laughter] still have running on my
mind.
I run about 3 or 4 miles a day on the
average-sometimes as much as 12 miles,
sometimes as little as 2 miles, and enjoy it
very much. My wife runs from 2 to 5
miles with me each day. It helps me to be
by myself, enjoy a conversation with my
wife, and I look forward to it very much.
And I stay in good shape, ready for run-
ning in the future.
Q. Thank you, Mr. President. You look
great.
THE PRESIDENT. Thank you.
PRESIDENT'S 1976 CAMPAIGN PROMISES
Q. Good evening, Mr. President. My
name is Stewart Weinberg. I'm 22 years
old, from Bayside, Queens, and I'd
Queens, and I'd
sure like to thank you for making me feel
almost as if I'm in touch with my Govern-
ment. I think it's great. I really do.
THE PRESIDENT. Thank you.
Q. I want you to know that in 1976 I
worked very hard for your election cam-
paign. [Laughter] Just cool it people, just
cool it. I worked very hard, and I'd like
you to take that into consideration when
I ask you this question. [Laughter]
Consider your 1976 election campaign
promises, and consider how those ideas
and programs have progressed. Consider
that the American dollar has been plum-
meting. Consider the rise in inflation, the
oil crisis, the gas lines, the tremendous
cost of home heating oil. Consider the
tumultuous nature of your ever-changing
Cabinet. Consider how we have added
more destruction to our ecosystem with
nuclear energy and oil spills. Consider
that we really don't have a comprehen-
sive national energy or health program.
And consider that I am a college-edu-
cated young man who has been unem-
ployed for 3 months, and I'm very un-
happy about that.
Evaluating what I've pointed out,
please explain why I should support you
for your reelection. What makes you
think your first term merits a reelection?
I want to know if I should work for you
a second time, and why.
THE PRESIDENT. Thank
Weinberg.
you,
Mr.
I've now been President for a little
more than 22 years. We've had some
notable achievements and we've had
some disappointments. I think in trying
to go down the list of things that you
described and I'll confine myself to that
and not talk about the good things,
okay?â€”to be fair to you.
Employment-when I was elected
President and inaugurated, the unem-
ployment rate was 8 percent. Now it's 6
1747
