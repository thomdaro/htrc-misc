White House Statement on Senate
Approval of the Legislation.
November 2, 1979
The President applauds the Thursday
night Senate action which would give an
important break to small savers. The bill
approved by the Senate contains major
recommendations that the President sub-
mitted to Congress in May.
The President proposed and now,
under the leadership of Banking Com-
mittee Chairman Senator William Prox-
mire, the Senate has agreed that major
deregulatory reforms in the financial area
are needed: the phaseout of federally
imposed deposit interceilings that limit
the interest that savers earn on their sav-
ings accounts, the reversal of an appellate
court decision that would have prohibited
the proconsumer automatic transfer
system, and the validation nationwide of
proconsumer NOW accounts and share.
draft accounts at credit unions.
"The Senate has taken a significant
step," the President said, â€œto provide
equity for savers in our country and to as-
sist depository institutions in competing
more effectively for funds." The President
urged that the House-Senate conference
committee members "act promptly to re-
turn to both Houses for final approval
legislation that will provide this critically
important relief to small savers."
