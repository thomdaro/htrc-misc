that must be preserved and enhanced, but
that much urban noise is harmful to urban
living and could be abated.
I am initiating today a program to re-
duce urban noise by making existing pro-
grams work better through interagency
and intergovernmental cooperation. I am
directing you, in consultation with other
federal agencies, to:
• initiate programs to achieve sound-
proofing and weatherization of noise-
sensitive buildings, such as schools
and hospitals;
• promote the use of quiet-design fea-
tures in the planning, design, and op-
eration of proposed urban transporta-
tion projects;
•
encourage noise-sensitive develop-
ments, such as housing, to be located
away from major noise sources;
help federal, state and local agencies
buy quiet equipment and products;
and
support neighborhood self-reliance
efforts seeking to identify and ad-
dress local noise problems.
The Federal Interagency Committee
on Noise, chaired by the Administrator of
the Environmental Protection Agency,
shall coordinate the implementation of
this program. The Chairman of my Inter-
agency Coordinating Council will assist
the Interagency Committee and other in-
tergovernmental cooperative efforts to as-
sure that this program is carried out fully
and promptly, including consultation with
state and local governments.
The Administrator of the Environmen-
tal Protection Agency will report to the
Chairman of the Council on Environ-
mental Quality and the Director of the
Office of Management and Budget on the
progress of this new program on Febru-
ary 1, 1980, and on August 1, 1980.

Memorandums From the President.
August 2, 1979
Memorandum for the Secretary of State
In my Environmental Message of Au-
gust 3,¹ 1979, I expressed concern about
the rapid disappearance of the earth's
forests, especially in the tropics and sub-
tropics. I believe there is much that the
United States can do in cooperation with
other nations to contribute to environ-
mentally sound care and management of
the earth's forests and to the well-being of
people affected by them.
I am directing you to give high priority
to the following matters in your budget
and program planning:
1
improved monitoring of world forest
trends, particularly tropical forests,
including use of satellite observa-
tions;
⚫ research on necessary preservation of
natural forest ecosystems and their
rich complex of plant and animal
life;
• research on multiple uses of highly
diverse tropical forests, including
management of natural stands, de-
velopment of ecologically sound for-
est plantations, and combined agri-
culture and forestry;
• studies on increasing yields in family-
scale tropical agriculture, to relieve
pressures on forest lands that are not
suitable for cultivation;
•
demonstration of integrated projects
for reforestation, more efficient fuel-
wood use, and alternative energy
sources;
• examination of how U.S. citizens and
U.S.-based corporations may be en-
couraged to support sound forest
management practices.
