Administration of Jimmy Carter, 1979
(a), 93 Stat. 15, 17, and 18, E.O. 12143,
sections 1-203 and 1-204, 44 Fed. Reg.
37191), which agreement consists of an
exchange of letters, one enclosing a sched-
ule of the United States concessions, a
copy of which exchange of letters, includ-
ing such enclosed schedule, is annexed to
this proclamation as Part 5 of Annex I.
4. Pursuant to Section 102 of the Trade
Act of 1974 (19 U.S.C. 2112), I have
determined that barriers to (and other
distortions of) international trade were
unduly burdening and restricting the for-
eign trade of the United States, and,
through the Special Representative for
Trade Negotiations (the Special Repre-
sentative), I have consulted with the ap-
propriate Committees of the Congress,
notified the House of Representatives and
the Senate of my intention to enter into
the agreements identified in Section 2(c)
of the Trade Agreements Act of 1979 (93
Stat. 148), transmitted to the Congress
copies of such agreements (a copy of one
of which agreements, with the Hungarian
People's Republic, is annexed to this
proclamation as Part 6 of Annex I), to-
gether with a draft of an implementing
bill and a statement of administrative
action, and such implementing bill, ap-
proving the agreements and the proposed
administrative action, has been enacted
into law (Section 2(a) of the Trade
Agreements Act of 1979 (93 Stat. 147)).
5. (a) Pursuant to Section 502 of the
Trade Agreements Act of 1979 (93 Stat.
251), I have determined that appropriate
concessions have been received from for-
eign countries under trade agreements
entered into under Title I of the Trade
Act of 1974 (19 U.S.C. 2111 et seq.);
(b) Pursuant to Section 601 (a) of the
Trade Agreements Act of 1979 (93 Stat.
267), I have determined that duty-free
treatment for certain articles now classi-
fied in the items of the Tariff Schedules
of the United States (19 U.S.C. 1202)
(TSUS) listed in, and certified pursuant
to, Section 601(a) (2) of that Act (93
Stat. 267), will provide treatment com-
parable to that provided by foreign coun-
tries under the Agreement on Trade in
Civil Aircraft;
(c) Pursuant to Section 503 (a) (2)
(A) of the Trade Agreements Act of
1979 (93 Stat. 251), I have determined,
after providing interested parties an op-
portunity to comment, that each article
identified in Annex IV to this proclama-
tion is not import sensitive;
(d) Pursuant to Section 855 (a) of the
Trade Agreements Act of 1979 (93 Stat.
295), I have determined that adequate
reciprocal concessions have been received,
under trade agreements entered into
under the Trade Act of 1974, for the ap-
plication of the rate of duty appearing in
rate column numbered 1 on January 1,
1979, for the comparable item on a proof
gallon basis in the case of alcoholic bever-

gations substantially the same as those
applicable to developing countries set
forth in the agreements listed in Section
2(c) (1), (2), (3), (4), and (5) of that
Act (93 Stat. 148) will be observed in
Taiwan.
