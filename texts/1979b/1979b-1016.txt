Nov. 16
Administration of Jimmy Carter, 1979
We've had some accomplishments in our
country in the last 34 months and in the
last 34 years, but there are many areas
where black voices and black women's
voices are not yet heard adequately.
Eleanor Holmes Norton is doing a good
job in the equal employment area, and
government is trying to eliminate the legal
bases for discrimination. But still the judi-
ciary, the Federal judiciary, has a lot to
say about it.
I've tried to seek your advice, and others
like you all over the country, and start
appointing black judges, because they
don't serve for 4 years, they don't serve for
8 years, they serve for a lifetime. And
again, we've got a long way to go. But I'm
very proud to say that I have already ap-
pointed more black judges in this country
than all other Presidents who've lived in
this house put together-because Doro-
thy would never let me forget about it.
[Laughter]
And so, I'm very grateful to you, as
President, for being my partner. This is
the greatest nation on Earth. And if we
have disappointments and if we have dif-
ferences sometimes, if we have debates
and divisions and if we have times when
we have temporary inconveniences and
delays in realizing the full desires of our
lives, we ought to recognize that, under-
neath, our country is the strongest and the
best and the freest country on Earth.
We've got a lot to be thankful for. God's
blessed us. And if we work together, as you
have done so well, then we'll make the
greatest nation on Earth even greater in
the future.
Thank you very much. God bless you
for all being here.
NOTE: The President spoke at 6:07 p.m. in the
East Room at the White House.
In his remarks, the President referred to
Dorothy Height, president of the council.
