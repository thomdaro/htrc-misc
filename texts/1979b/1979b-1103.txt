of the following provisions or statutes:
(a) Section 101(b) (2) of the Trade
Act of 1974 (19 U.S.C. 2111(b) (2)), by
virtue of the fact that the rate of duty
existing on January 1, 1975, applicable
to the article was not more than 5 percent
ad valorem (or ad valorem equivalent) ;
(b) Section 109 (b) of the Trade Act
of 1974 (19 U.S.C. 2119 (b)), by virtue
of the fact that I have determined, pur-
suant to that section, that the decrease
authorized by that section will simplify
the computation of the amount of duty
imposed with respect to the article;
(c) Sections 503 (a) (2) (A) and 503
(a)(3) to (6) of the Trade Agreements
Act of 1979 (93 Stat. 251 and 252) by
virtue of the fact that they permit de-
partures from the staging provisions of
Section 109 (a) of the Trade Act of 1974
(19 U.S.C. 2119(a));
(d) Sections 502 (a), 855 (a), and 601
(a) of the Trade Agreements Act of 1979
(93 Stat. 251, 295, and 267) by virtue of
the authority in such sections for specified
concessions based on reciprocity, but in
the case of the last such section only after
the conditions for acceptance of the
Agreement on Trade in Civil Aircraft,
identified in Section 2(c) (10) of that Act
(93 Stat. 148), are fulfilled;
(e) Sections 505 through 513, inclu-
sive, of the Trade Agreements Act of
1979 (93 Stat. 252-257) by virtue of the
fact that they permit exceeding the limi-
tations specified in Sections 101 or 109
of the Trade Act of 1974 (19 U.S.C. 2111
or 2119);
(f) Section 255 of the Trade Expan-
sion Act of 1962 (19 U.S.C. 1885) by
virtue of the fact that it permits termina-
tion of proclamations issued pursuant to
authority contained in that act;
(g) Section 2(a) of the Trade Agree-
ments Act of 1979 (93 Stat. 147) by vir-
tue of its approval of the agreements
identified in Section 2 (c) of that Act (93
Stat. 148); and
(h) Section 304 (a) (3) (J) of the
Tariff Act of 1930 (19 U.S.C. 1304 (a)
(3) (J)) and Section 602 (f) of the Trade
Act of 1974 (19 U.S.C. 2101 note), by
virtue of the fact that I have found that
the effectiveness of the proviso to Section
304 (a) (3) (J) with respect to the mark-
ing of articles provided for in headnote 2
of part 1 of schedule 2 of the TSUS is
required or appropriate to carry out the
first agreement identified in the third re-
cital of this proclamation.

including those of the type specified in
clause (a) or (b) of the sixth recital of
this proclamation, which involves the de-
termination of the ad valorem equivalent
of a specific or compound rate of duty,
and in the case of each modification in
the form of an import duty, the United
States International Trade Commission
determined, pursuant to Section 601(4)
of the Trade Act of 1974 (19 U.S.C. 2481
(4)) in accordance with Section 4(e) of
Executive Order No. 11846 of March 27,
1975, (3 CFR 1971-1975 Comp. 973),
and at my direction, the ad valorem
equivalent of the specific or compound
rate, on the basis of the value of imports
of the article concerned during a period
determined by it to be representative,
utilizing, to the extent practicable, the
standards of valuation contained in Sec-
tions 402 and 402a of the Tariff Act of
1930 (19 U.S.C. 1401a and 1402) appli-
cable to the article during such represent-
ative period.

and the Trade Agreements Act of 1979, I
determined that the modification or con-
tinuance of existing duties or other im-
port restrictions or the continuance of
existing duty-free or excise treatment
hereinafter proclaimed is required or ap-
