think it might be best to-do we have a
photographer here? I'll stand right over
here by the door, and if you all will just
come by on your way out and let me
shake hands and thank you for coming
individually. And we'll get a photograph
and send it to you.
Thank you.

Food Stamp Act Amendments
Statement on Signing H.R. 4057 Into Law.
August 15, 1979
I have signed into law amendments to
the Food Stamp Act of 1977 which will
allow us to continue program operations
without cutting benefits for needy food
stamp families and also will provide a
series of new measures to reduce error
and fraud. These amendments are needed
chiefly because inflation in food prices
has boosted program costs well above the
ceiling on program spending contained
in the 1977 act. The Congress has acted
swiftly to raise the spending cap for this
fiscal year and to appropriate the addi-
tional funding we need to avoid closing
the program down entirely for the month
of September. The legislation also includes
measures to provide additional benefits
for elderly and disabled households with
high medical or shelter costs. I am also
pleased that the Congress has included
several antifraud provisions the adminis-
tration has recommended.
The need for additional funding for
the food stamp program is yet another
