Highway Safety and National
Traffic and Motor Vehicle
Safety Acts of 1966
Message to the Congress Transmitting Two
Reports. October 12, 1979
To the Congress of the United States:
The 1966 traffic safety legislation which
initiated a cohesive national effort to curb
deaths, injuries and accidents on the Na-
tion's highways also requires that annual
reports be rendered to the Congress on the
administration of the Acts. This is the
12th year these reports have described the
problems and the remedies that have been
applied to ameliorate them.
The report on motor vehicle safety in-
cludes the annual reporting requirement
in Title I of the Motor Vehicle Informa-
tion and Cost Savings Act of 1972
(bumper standards). An annual report
also is required by the Energy Policy and
Conservation Act of 1975 which amended
the Motor Vehicle Information and Cost
Savings Act and directed the Secretary of
Transportation to set, adjust and enforce
motor vehicle fuel economy standards.
Similar reporting requirements are con-
tained in the Department of Energy Act
of 1978 with respect to the use of ad-
vanced technology by the automobile in-
dustry. These requirements have been met
in the Third Annual Fuel Economy Re-
port, the highlights of which are summar-
ized in the motor vehicle safety report.
In the Highway Safety Acts of 1973
and 1976, the Congress expressed its spe-
cial interest in certain aspects of traffic
safety which are addressed in the volume
on highway safety. The annual reporting
requirements set forth in the Highway
Safety Act of 1978 will be covered in
future editions of this report as may be
appropriate.
