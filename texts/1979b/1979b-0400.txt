FEDERAL PAY COMPARABILITY
ALTERNATIVE PLAN
Because of economic conditions affect-
ing the general welfare, I hereby transmit
to Congress the following alternative plan,
in accordance with 5 U.S.C. 5305 (c) (1):
The adjustment in rates of pay of each
Federal statutory pay system to become
effective on the first day of the first ap-
plicable pay period that begins on or
after October 1, 1979, shall be limited
to a 7 percent increase at each grade
in lieu of the adjustment determined
under the comparability procedure set
forth in 5 U.S.C. 5305(a)-(b); Pro-
vided, however, that the full adjust-
ment determined under the compara-
bility procedure shall take effect to the
extent it does not increase any rate of
pay to an amount of more than $8,902
per year.
In accordance with 5 U.S.C. 5382 (c),
and subject to any applicable statu-
tory restrictions on the availability of
appropriated funds, the following rates
of basic pay for the Senior Executive
Service shall become effective on the
first day of the first applicable pay pe-
riod that begins on or after October 1,
1979:

Announcement on the President's Proposal.
August 31, 1979
President Carter proposed to Congress
today a pay increase of 7 percent affecting
3.5 million military and civilian employ-
ees. The President's proposal would raise
the pay of 1.4 million Federal civilian
workers and 2.1 million members of the
armed services.
The law governing Federal civilian
white-collar pay requires that the Bureau
of Labor Statistics conduct an annual na-
tionwide survey of salaries paid private
sector employees who hold jobs similar to
their Federal counterparts. This private
sector salary data is then compared with
Federal salaries by a body called the Pres-
ident's Pay Agent: the Secretary of Labor
and the Directors of the Office of Man-
agement and Budget and the Office of
Personnel Management. This year the
Pay Agent found that an average increase
of 10.41 percent would raise Federal
white-collar salaries to the level of private
sector counterparts.
The law provides the President author-
ity to propose the lower increase because
of "national emergency or economic
conditions affecting the general welfare."
The President believes strongly that a
7-percent increase is required this year.
The 1980 budget had provided for a 5.5-
percent increase. The President recog-
nizes, however, that employees are faced
with a higher cost of living than when he
submitted his 1980 budget. For example,
current forecasts of CPI increases have
risen 3.2 percentage points for 1979 and
2.0 percentage points for 1980 over those
used in the budget.
By recommending 7 percent instead,
the President's action will add a little less
than $1 billion to the $60 billion that the
budget already provides for these workers'
annual salaries.
"Inflation continues to be the single
greatest threat to our economy and is a
national problem of foremost concern,"
the President said in his message to the
1530
