Administration of Jimmy Carter, 1979

DAVENPORT
Ms. BROWN. Yeah. One, I'd like to
know how you like Davenport.
THE PRESIDENT. Well, Davenport is
just one of my favorite places. When I
was campaigning for President, I came
into the Davenport Airport, and I remem-
ber we only had about 15 or 20 people
there to meet me.
This morning, we had thousands of
people here to meet me as President. And
I've always found, whether there was a
small group or a large one, that the peo-
ple in Davenport are very enthusiastic
and very friendly and very patriotic.
One of the most important things,
though, is that Davenport seems to be a
very unified community. You've never
been afraid to face difficulties. And I
think that you're living in one of the most
productive areas of the entire world as far
as farmland is concerned, has given you a
sense that you contribute to a worldwide,
beneficial life for other people. So, there's
an unselfishness here and a friendship
here and a spirit of unity here in Daven-
port and a spirit of patriotism that makes
your community really a good place to
live.
And I might say that you've got the
Mississippi River as a bonus. So, you
couldn't have it better.
MS. BROWN. That's Davenport.
The President. Thank you, Debbie.
Ms. BROWN. You're welcome.
MR. JACKSON. The next caller is Mark
Larson in Milan, Illinois.
MILITARY PAY INCREASE
MR. LARSON. Hello.
THE PRESIDENT. Good morning, Mark.
Go ahead.
MR. LARSON. Thank you, sir.
My question has to do with a subject
that's a little off from the energy problem,
although I am behind your proposals and
I hope Congress gets behind you as quick-
ly as the Quad City people have.
I'm on leave from the military right
now. I'm in the Navy, sir, like you were.
And before I left I heard that the military
was going to get a 5.5-percent pay raise.
Is this true, sir?
THE PRESIDENT. Yes, that's true, Mark.
We will have a 5.5-percent pay raise for
the military. It's a little bit less than the in-
flation rate, but I think it's enough to get
us by. And we hope that in a very short
time, we'll be able to turn this 10- or 12-
year
inflation rate around and let us have
a more stable cost of living.
As you know, when we import too
much oil we also import unemployment
and we also import inflation. So, the eco-
nomic situation in our country is very
closely tied in with the energy situation.
One of the best things about our Nation
is, however, that we have such tremen-
dous productivity in our farming areas.
We now are exporting more farm prod-
ucts overseas than we ever have before in
history. In 1978 we also set a world rec-
ord, and in 1977 we also set a record. So,
each year we're exporting more farm
products, which helps us control inflation,
and of course, dealing with the energy
question will help it as well.
But the pay increase for the military
will be as you described, and I think this
is certainly well deserved by all of you
who serve in the Navy and the other
branches of the Armed Forces.
MR. LARSON. Well, we're behind you,
sir.
THE PRESIDENT. Thank you, Mark.
That means a lot to me.
MR. LARSON. Well, thank you, sir. Have
a good day.
MR. JACKSON. The next caller is Chris
Swanson from Tipton, Iowa. Chris, go
ahead.
