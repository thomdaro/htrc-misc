Administration of Jimmy Carter, 1979
Are you less optimistic now as a result of

ADMINISTRATION OFFICIAL. Mr. Presi-
dent, I would just interject, without the
60-percent increase from OPEC, we
would not face this problem. Clearly, that
problem, Mr. President, is in fact due to
the 60-percent increase in oil.
ADMINISTRATION OFFICIAL. With re-
gard for inflation, also.
U.S. BALANCE OF TRADE
THE PRESIDENT. What will the OPEC
price increase cost us in balance of trade?
ADMINISTRATION OFFICIAL. We esti-
mate now that next year the cost may be
around $70 billion; this year, $58 billion,
which compares to $42 billion last year.
So, it's a substantial increase in the bill we
have to pay for imported oil.
ADMINISTRATION OFFICIAL. It's a very
serious economic problem. The only thing
I would hesitate to the only thing I'd
like for you not to do is to pin me down
specifically to a zero growth rate. Until we
see the final figures run through the com-
puter, I won't know.
ADMINISTRATION OFFICIAL. It'll be
about 10 days.
THE PRESIDENT. We'll issue that new
estimate on the 15th, I think.
ENERGY AND INFLATION TASK FORCES
Q. You mentioned the inflation task
force a little while ago. Is that something
new?
THE PRESIDENT. Yes.
Q. And are they studying controls as
one of the options at this point?
THE PRESIDENT. The inflation task
force is something new.

Q. Would you like to talk a little bit
about it?
THE PRESIDENT. No, I don't want to
presuppose anything. I think the Con-
gress Members would resent my saying
what we collectively are going to do. The
essence of it is that Bob Byrd and Tip and
all recognize that we have some special
problems economically, and instead of the
executive branch developing a program
or the Congress developing programs and
just having proper consultations, that
we'll work much more closely on a con-
tinuing basis with a few key people.
Before I left Washington, Bob Byrd
called me on the phone and gave me
the list of the Members of the Senate that
he had recommended. And I understand
that after I left, Tip O'Neill has submit-
ted his list of the House Members-two
lists, one for energy and one for inflation.
Both Democrats and Republicans could
be designated by the leaders.
gest mandatory controls at all?
Q. Do you anticipate that they will sug-
THE PRESIDENT. I don't want to pre-
suppose that.
Q. How would you feel if they did?
THE PRESIDENT. I would say no.
Q. Are controls one of the options that
the task force will consider?
THE PRESIDENT. I'm opposed to man-
datory controls.
Q. When do you expect to have a re-
port or a recommendation?
THE PRESIDENT. This is in the embry-
onic stage. We've set up the mechanism,
and I can't-
Q. Is it an all-congressional group the
task force?
THE PRESIDENT. If I remember right,
Bob Byrd gave me about seven or eight
names from the Senate. I presume Tip
will do about the same on the House, and
then I'll appoint members representing
