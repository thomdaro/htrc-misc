Foreword
To function effectively, and to keep faith with our founding principles, the
government and the citizens of this country must work together in partnership.
One of the purposes of these Presidential papers is to record that partnership—
to set down the requests and responses, concerns and hopes of a President and a
people.
The partnership is vividly demonstrated by the fact that between the accounts
of Presidential words and action during the latter half of 1979 are transcribed the
voices of dozens of Americans-teachers and farmers, shopowners and factory
workers who have spoken with me in town halls, schools, churches, and
synagogues across the country.
The 6-month period covered by this volume saw a number of significant devel-
opments for our country-the submission to the Senate of the SALT II treaty, the
Tokyo economic summit, the domestic discussions at Camp David, our steady
progress towards national energy security, the establishment of a new Department
of Education, and the uniting of the American people behind our responses to
crises in Iran and Afghanistan.
Throughout these months, the American people and their government have
met the tests of change in keeping with our commitment to the ideals that have
guided this Nation since its creation.
The record of that partnership in these papers represents the achievement of
many. It is open to all, and I encourage all to read it. For democracy, more than
other systems of government, depends upon an open and honest interchange of
facts and feelings between leaders and citizens.
