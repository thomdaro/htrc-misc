President of the Senate. December 29, 1979
Dear Mr. Speaker: (Dear Mr. Presi-
dent:)
In accordance with the authority con-
tained in section 6 of the Export Adminis-
tration Act of 1979 (Public Law 96-72
of September 29, 1979; hereinafter "the
Act"), I hereby extend export controls
maintained for foreign policy purposes as
specified in Enclosure 1. In accordance
with section 6(e) of the Act I hereby
notify Congress of this extension.
I am also submitting, as Enclosure 2,
my conclusions with respect to: the cri-
teria set forth in section 6(b) of the Act;
the nature and result of alternative means
attempted to achieve the purposes of these
controls or the reasons for extending them
without attempting any such alternative
means; and the ways in which such con-
trols will further significantly the foreign
policy of the United States or will further
its declared international obligations.
Pursuant to section 6(k) of the Act, the
