tion with its consideration of the amend-
ment.
The International Convention on Load
Lines establishes uniform international
principles governing the safe loading of
ships in all seasons and waters. The pur-
pose of this amendment is to expedite the
procedure for amending the technical an-
nexes to the Convention.
I believe that the proposed amendment
is highly desirable. The Convention's
present amendment procedure has made
it impossible to bring into force many
technical improvements to the require-
ments of the Convention. The new
procedure will greatly facilitate and
accelerate the entry into force of these
essential improvements.
I recommend that the Senate give con-
sideration to this amendment and advice
and consent to its acceptance.

Department of Education

Remarks at the Bill Signing Ceremony.

THE PRESIDENT. The first thing I want to
do is to invite into the room the real bene-
ficiaries of the new Department of Educa-
tion, a group of fourth grade students
from Brent Elementary School. This
morning they can stand where they want
to. [Laughter]
In 1962 I was serving on a local school
board in the Deep South and had been
for 7 years. We were going through a time
of sociological change, when public,
elected officials, and churches, business
leaders stood mute while children suffered
because of ancient policies of racial dis-
crimination. That situation changed be-
cause of schoolteachers and the courage of
educators, who saw the devastating effect
of continued racial policies in the South
and throughout the country.
I decided to run for the State Senate
to see if I could help in Georgia, based on
my own experiences under those trying
circumstances. And when I got to Atlanta
as a newly elected senator, I had one re-
quest, and that was that I be put on the
education committee. And I was.
I later ran for Governor, and my prime
campaign commitment was to improve
education in Georgia. And we did. I spent
probably 25 percent of my time as Gover-
nor trying to deal with better education
for our students.
When I became President, that situa-
tion was drastically different. There has
not been in the Federal Government an
adequate mechanism by which we can
improve the quality of education in the
United States, and I say that not in criti-
cism of those who've served under such
difficult circumstances. But I think you
could interrogate local elementary and
high school principals and classroom
teachers, county school board members,
State school superintendents, college pro-.
fessors, university presidents, Governors,
and you would find an almost complete
negative attitude toward how much sup-
port is given from the Federal Govern-
ment for better education, compared with
the tremendous potential that exists.
As FritzÂ¹ pointed out, we have in-
creased tremendously the Federal finan-
cial contribution to education, 60 percent
in 22 years, with the help of the Con-
gress. This has obviously been focused in
a very fine way, but the interrelationship
between local people-public and private
