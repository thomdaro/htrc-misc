THE PRESIDENT'S
NEWS CONFERENCE OF
NOVEMBER 28, 1979
SITUATION IN IRAN
THE PRESIDENT. For the last 24 days our
Nation's concern has been focused on our
fellow Americans being held hostage in
Iran. We have welcomed some of them
home to their families and their friends.
But we will not rest nor deviate from our
efforts until all have been freed from
their imprisonment and their abuse. We
hold the Government of Iran fully re-
sponsible for the well-being and the safe
return of every single person.
I want the American people to under-
stand the situation as much as possible,
but there may be some questions tonight
which I cannot answer fully, because of
my concern for the well-being of the
hostages.
First of all, I would like to say that I
am proud of this great Nation, and I want
to thank all Americans for their prayers,
their courage, their persistence, their
strong support and patience. During
these past days our national will, our
courage, and our maturity have all been
severely tested, and history will show that
the people of the United States have met
every test.
In the days to come, our determination
may be even more sorely tried, but we
will continue to defend the security, the
honor, and the freedom of Americans
everywhere. This Nation will never yield
to blackmail. For all Americans, our con-
stant concern is the well-being and the
safety of our fellow citizens who are being
held illegally and irresponsibly hostage in
Iran.
The actions of Iran have shocked the
civilized world. For a government to ap-
plaud mob violence and terrorism, for a
government actually to support and, in
effect, participate in the taking and the
holding of hostages is unprecedented in
human history. This violates not only the
most fundamental precepts of interna-
tional law but the common ethical and
religious heritage of humanity. There is
no recognized religious faith on Earth
which condones kidnaping. There is no
recognized religious faith on Earth which
condones blackmail. There is certainly no
