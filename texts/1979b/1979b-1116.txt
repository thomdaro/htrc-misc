Administration of Jimmy Carter, 1979
help low-income people combat poverty
and poverty-related problems.
I am especially pleased that this bill
emphasizes use of existing authority for
the new urban volunteer program, an im-
portant part of the comprehensive urban
policy which I first presented in March
1978. Included in my urban initiatives
and adopted in this act are the Urban
Volunteer Corps, which will provide
neighborhood groups with skilled volun-
teers, and a Good Neighbor Fund to make
small grants to local urban organizations
that undertake projects for community
development. In addition, the act author-
izes a fixed-income consumer counseling
program to help low-income elderly
people manage their money and Helping
Hand programs through which volunteer,
in-home services will be provided to
reduce the number of the elderly
and the handicapped requiring institu-
tionalization.
In my urban policy I called for a part-
nership involving Federal, State, and local
governments, the private sector, and
neighborhood groups to revitalize the Na-
tion's distressed urban communities. An
important part of that policy was the de-
sire to encourage citizens to take an active
part in this revitalization activity. S. 239
will help to make such voluntary efforts a
reality.
Some of the activities covered by the
new urban volunteer program are cur-
rently being conducted on a demonstra-
tion basis in selected areas around the
country, where, at minimal cost, volun-
teers have been successful in helping to
solve problems and improve the quality
of life in their communities.
With the passage of this legislation, 15
out of the 19 legislative proposals I origi-
nally submitted to Congress in my urban
policy have been signed into law.
Finally, I want to recognize the diligent
efforts and support of Senator Alan Cran-
ston, and Representative Carl Perkins in
getting this legislation enacted.
NOTE: As enacted, S. 239 is Public Law 96-
143, approved December 13.
