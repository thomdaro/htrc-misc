Export-Import Bank
Executive Order 12166. October 19, 1979
By the authority vested in me as Presi-
dent of the United States of America by
Section 2(b) (1) (B) of the Export-Im-
port Bank Act of 1945, as amended (12
U.S.C. 635(b)(1)(B)), and by Section
301 of Title 3 of the United States Code,
it is hereby ordered as follows:
1-101. The function vested in the
President by Section 2(b) (1) (B) of the
Export-Import Bank Act of 1945, as
amended (12 U.S.C. 635 (b) (1) (B)), is
delegated to the Secretary of State. That
function is the authority to determine
that a denial by the Export-Import Bank
of an application for credit would be in
the national interest, where such action
could clearly and importantly advance
United States policy in such areas as
international terrorism, nuclear prolif-
eration, environmental protection and
human rights.
1-102. Before making such a determi-
nation, the Secretary of State shall con-
sult with the Secretary of Commerce and
the heads of other interested Executive
agencies.
1-103. In accord with Section 2(b)
(1) (B) of that Act, only in those cases
where the Secretary of State has made
such a determination should the Export-
Import Bank deny an application for
credit for nonfinancial or noncommercial
considerations.

Remarks at a White House Reception
Commemorating the Second Anniversary
of the Program. October 19, 1979
MR. WATSON. It's a great pleasure to wel-
come all of you to the White House.
As I look around the room, I feel as
though this is Old Home Week, because
there are so many familiar faces here
who've worked so hard on what we are
here to celebrate. And I will say only with
this one remark, because it will be under-
scored by several of the people on the
1965
