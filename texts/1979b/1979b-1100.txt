Dec. 11
Administration of Jimmy Carter, 1979
of the Tariff Act of 1930. This report
should be prepared on an annual basis,
beginning in November 1980, until
further notice. I would plan to have these
reports discussed with appropriate Soviet
officials through existing channels.
This determination is to be published
in the FEDERAL REGISTER.
JIMMY CARTER
Pursuant to section 406(b) and 202 of
the Trade Act of 1974 (P.L. 93-618, 88
Stat. 1978), I have determined the action
I will take with respect to the report of
the United States International Trade
Commission (USITC), transmitted to me
on October 12, 1979, concerning the re-
sults of its investigation of a petition for
import injury filed on behalf of 12 U.S.
producers and one U.S. distributor of
anhydrous ammonia provided for under
items 417.22 and 480.65 of the Tariff
Schedules of the United States (TSUS).
After considering all relevant aspects
of the case, including those considera- Holiday for Federal Employees
tions set forth in section 202 (c) of the
Trade Act of 1974, I have determined
that provision of import relief is not in
the national economic interest for the fol-
lowing reasons:
1. Anticipated conditions in the U.S.
and overseas markets for anhydrous am-
monia do not warrant import relief at
this time. The industry is currently op-
erating at 86 percent of capacity and
should continue to operate at comparable
levels, prices are sharply higher and ex-
pected to continue rising, and strong
market conditions are projected for the
current and next marketing years. Given
anticipated growth in demand for grains
and other crops, it is critical that farmers
have access to sufficient fertilizer supplies
at reasonable prices.
2. Relief would not limit the growth in
U.S. imports of anhydrous ammonia but
will merely shift the source of foreign sup-
plies from the Soviets to other low-cost
producers. Thus, the domestic industry
would realize little benefit from relief and
relief would be unlikely to promote indus-
try adjustment.
You should request the U.S. Interna-
tional Trade Commission to issue a factual
report on overall market conditions for
ammonia as prescribed under section 332
