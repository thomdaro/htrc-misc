National Employ the
Handicapped Week, 1979
Proclamation 4685. September 13, 1979
By the President of the United States
of America
A Proclamation
The past decade has been marked by
significant advances for handicapped
people.
Such laws as the Rehabilitation Act of
1973 protect many handicapped individ-
uals from discrimination in employment
and services. Handicapped workers have
made great progress in entering the job
market, and those already in the labor
force are moving up to better jobs. More
of our Nation's buildings and public
transportation systems are being made ac-
cessible. Many handicapped individuals
have been moving out of institutions into
homes, apartments, and community facili-
ties which facilitate independent living.
As handicapped individuals move into
the mainstream of society, more and more
of their fellow citizens are overcoming
their prejudices and seeing handicapped
individuals as people.
Yet much remains to be done. Many
qualified handicapped people, including
many disabled veterans, are unemployed
or underemployed, and others are not
promoted because of discriminatory atti-
tudes rather than an inability to perform.
Many buildings still have thoughtless
architectural barriers that prevent handi-
capped persons from getting jobs and edu-
cation. Public transportation is still not
available to all handicapped individuals.
This country needs the creativity, skill
and participation of all our citizens. To
affirm our commitment to equality for
the handicapped members of our society,
