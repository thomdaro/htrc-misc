15th Annniversary of the Job
Corps
Statement by the President. October 17, 1979
The Job Corps began 15 years ago on
the premise that, if given the opportunity,
young people who had grown up in pov-
erty and frustration could become respon-
sible, employable, and productive citizens.
With government, labor, and industry
working together, this idea has become a
reality for more than 700,000 young men
and women who have received basic edu-
cation, skills training, work experience,
and health care through the Job Corps.
With their new skills and pride in accom-
plishment, Job Corps graduates are enter-
ing the labor market, confident that they
can become contributing workers with
satisfying careers.
In the years to come, I know that the
Job Corps will continue to assist young
men and women, who might otherwise
have been neglected and forgotten, to
lead rewarding lives.
