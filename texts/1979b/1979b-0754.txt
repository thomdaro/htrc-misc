Q. [Inaudible]
THE PRESIDENT. No one can control
the stock market or predict what it's going
to do.
Q. [Inaudible]
THE PRESIDENT. I hope not. We've
done everything we could in spite of high
interest rates to hold up employment in
the construction industry. And as I told

about 1.8 million homes being built every

to accommodate that problem. I think
we'll minimize unemployment.
Q. [Inaudible]-if the interest rate sit-
uation does begin to hit, can the construc-
tion industry be-[inaudible].
THE PRESIDENT. Yes, we are assessing
it constantly. But I think right now our
economic policies are sound and well-

them.
Q. [Inaudible]
THE PRESIDENT. My first priority is to
deal with inflation.
