ment, the Secretary of the Interior, the

Transportation, the Administrator of the
Environmental Protection Agency, the
Administrator of the General Services Ad-
ministration, the Chairman of the Council
on Environmental Quality
In Environmental Message of Au-
my
gust 2, 1979, I recognized that integrated
pest management (IPM) has both eco-
nomic and environmental benefits and
should be encouraged in both research and
operational programs of federal agencies.
Therefore, I am directing that each of
your agencies:
Council on Environmental Quality. Your
agency should appoint one representative
to serve on this Committee who is an As-
sistant Secretary, Assistant Administrator,
or the equivalent. The Committee is to
report to me by June 30, 1980 on progress
made by federal agencies in the advance-
ment of IPM and on any institutional
barriers thereto.
The Committee may request any Exec-
utive agency to furnish such information,
advice, and service as may be useful for
the fulfillment of the Committee's func-
tions. Each of your agencies shall coop-
erate with and furnish support to the
Committee as needed to carry out its
functions.
Please give these assignments your im-
mediate attention.

better or worse, our nation's environment,
our utilization of energy, and our urban
areas. I also recognized that it is my
Administration's policy to enhance en-
vironmental protection, energy conserva-
tion, and urban revitalization and that
the nation's transportation system must
provide greater support for these national
goals.
I fully support the reorientation of
urban transportation programs and proj-
