you need the confidence of the American Carter, if the 1980 election should throw

us together."
THE PRESIDENT. I don't agree with your
premise. I think your information is in-
correct. Recently, as you know, there were
two polls conducted among the Members
of the House, one by the Washington
Post; one by the New York Times. I
didn't participate in them, but I saw the
results. I think in the South, which did
include Texas, 88 percent of the Demo-
crats said they prefer to have me on the
ballot with them next year. I think 3 per-
cent said Kennedy, and the rest were
divided among a numerous number of
people.
I have already seen the effectiveness
with which the House has dealt with the
windfall profits tax. I think they did a
good job. Their bill is roughly equivalent
to my own. The only problem with it is it
only lasts until 1990. I prefer a permanent
windfall profits tax.
But I think the polls that were con-
ducted by those two news media, respect-
able news media, are a better indication
than the results that you apparently got
from your interviews.
MAYOR NEIL GOLDSCHMIDT
Q. Mr. Carter, I'm from Portland,
Oregon, and I understand the mayor's in
town. I'd like to know, sir, if you intend
to appoint him or have youâ€”as head of
the Department of Transportation or
some other Federal job?
THE PRESIDENT. I haven't met with
him and don't know what I will do yet.
I will discuss this matter with him and
some others as well. I have a great respect
for Neil Goldschmidt and so do all the
members of my staff. I will make a deci-
sion on this matter soon. He's not the
only one being considered, and I don't
want to predict what the outcome might
be.
Q. Will it be today, sir?
THE PRESIDENT. I can't say. Do you-
does anyone know when Neil's coming?
We'll find out. I don't know when he's
This is a very difficult political season,
and for someone from Texas and from the
other oil-producing States, I realize that
there is a duality of responsibility to the
consumers, on the one hand-and there
are many consumers in Texas-and to all
those who depend upon the oil industry
and the natural gas industry for their going to see me.
livelihood or who have a natural affinity
for it because Texas is an oil-producing
State.
My belief is that the Congress will act
courageously and will implement the
windfall profits tax, the security fund de-
rived from it, the proper expenditure of
those funds through the corporation to
produce new kinds of energy, and the pro-
duction board to expedite those decisions.
My guess is that the House will, next
Tuesday, vote for the standby rationing
authority in an acceptable fashion. So, I
don't really recruit people now to say,

HOME HEATING OIL SUPPLIES
Q. Mr. President, I'm from Hillsboro,
New Hampshire. As I'm sure you're
aware, we have a primary election there
in February. February's a cold month up
there; between now and then there's a lot
of cold nights. According to Senator
John Durkin we are 20 million barrels
behind last year in stockpiling oil. What
I would like to know is, do you, as a
candidate, seriously believe that you'll
have a chance without taking further
direct action to ensure a more adequate
supply of heating oil? And if you do in-
