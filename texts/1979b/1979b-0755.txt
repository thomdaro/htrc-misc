White House Statement on Senate Energy
Committee Approval of the Legislation.
October 11, 1979
The President welcomes the over-
whelmingly favorable action by the Senate
Energy Committee in establishing an en-
ergy security corporation. The legislation
embodies the three elements which the
President has said are essential to a syn-
thetic fuels program: a long-term com-
mitment to a substantial synthetic fuels
effort, an independent entity to carry out
this commitment, and the authority and
immediate funding for a strong start.
The President is grateful to Chairman
Jackson and Senators Johnston and
Domenici, as well as to the other commit-
tee members, for the dedication and effort
that led to the Committee's favorable
vote. The President hopes the Senate will
promptly follow the Energy Committee's
vote so the Nation can soon begin the
important task of producing synthetic
fuels and reducing our need for foreign
oil.
