THE PRESIDENT. Good morning.
Q. Good morning, Mr. President. If
you'd only let us know, we wouldn't have
come out at 7 o'clock.
Q. Or woken up at 7 o'clock.
The President. Did you wake up at 7?
Q. None of us.
Q. Close enough for me-for me it was
close.
Q. Let me ask you a question. Does it
concern us that there are the Russian
troops in Cuba? What is your informa-
tion?
THE PRESIDENT. Well, Secretary Vance
is going to make a statement in Washing-
ton about that today. I've discussed it
with him this morning. I think I'll let his
statement stand.
Q. Is it a very serious matter?
THE PRESIDENT. Well, I'll let Secretary
Vance's statement stand today, Sam [Sam
Donaldson, ABC News].
Q. But, to, I mean, kind of forestall any
other questions, you are making the deci-
sions on this, though? It is not Secretary
Vance-
THE PRESIDENT. That's right.
Q. â€”because that would be tomor-
row's question.
THE PRESIDENT. I understand. Secre-
tary Vance and I've discussed it, and he'll
make a statement today for me.
Q. Do you have something to say about
your new United Nations Ambassador,
Mr. President?
THE PRESIDENT. Have they announced
the-
Q. Eleven o'clock. Yes, several minutes
ago in Americus.
THE PRESIDENT. Yes. I will say some-
thing about him. He's a highly qualified
professional, thoroughly familiar with the
major issues that confront the United Na-
tions, and I have complete confidence in
him.
I've consulted with a lot of people
before making the selection, and Ambas-
sador Don McHenry fulfills all the re-
quirements, I think, for a superb appoint-
ment. He's been highly recommended to
me by Ambassador Andrew Young and
by Secretary Vance and many others. His
whole life has been devoted to ambassa-
dorial or diplomatic service. And I've had
a thorough discussion with him earlier this
week about the major issues that confront
the United Nations-North-South rela-
tionships, southern Africa, Mideast, and
1589
