Administration of Jimmy Carter, 1979
Department of Commerce
Exchange of Letters on the Resignation of
Juanita M. Kreps as Secretary.
October 4, 1979
To Secretary Juanita Kreps
With the greatest reluctance and regret,
I accept your resignation. I wish it were
possible for you to remain, for your ab-
sence will be a great loss for our admin-
istration.
Not only have I valued your advice on a
broad range of economic matters but
under your leadership your department
has built an impressive record.
Also, in the growing area of interna-
tional trade, your accomplishments have
earned the department the major new
role it will soon begin to play. You have
begun the essential process of increasing
the awareness of our country of the ad-
vantages of increased trade and exports.
The Trade Agreement you negotiated
during your visit to the People's Republic
of China marks an historic step in estab-
lishing normal relations with one-quarter
of the people who live on earth. In
Europe, the Middle East, in the Soviet
Union and other countries you have been
a splendid emissary for the United States.
Finally, with love and genuine friend-
ship I wish you well. We shall miss you.
It is my hope that we shall have the con-
tinuing benefit of your advice and counsel
in the future.
Sincerely,
Dear Mr. President:
JIMMY CARTER
October 3, 1979
It is with deep regret that I offer my
resignation as the Secretary of Commerce.
My reasons are altogether personal.
Nearly three years ago, when we first
met to discuss the economic issues that
would face you as President, we were
acutely aware of the problems before the
Nation. Unemployment was high, the re-
cession dragged on, and business confi-
dence lagged. Threats of protectionism
were widespread. Under your leadership,
jobs have been created and the unemploy-
ment rate lowered significantly; businesses
have prospered; new trade agreements
promise larger markets for our producers
and higher levels of living for the Ameri-
can people.
We now face the critical issues of
rapidly rising energy costs and the infla-
tion they generate. We must implement
the trade agreements. In order to take ad-
vantage of widening world markets, we
must find ways to increase our productivity
and competitive strength. For the resolu
tion of these longrun problems we shall
need the most imaginative approaches,
the most realistic assessment of alterna-
tives.
While I am pleased with the progress
we have made, I should have liked to con-
tinue with the work we have begun. You
have my wholehearted support and my
great admiration.
Sincerely,
JUANITA
[The President, The White House, Washington,
D.C. 20500]
