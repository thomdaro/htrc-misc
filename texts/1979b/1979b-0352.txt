DECONTROL OF OIL PRICES; NUCLEAR
POWER
MR. SWANSON. Good morning, Mr.
President.
THE PRESIDENT. Good morning, Chris.
MR. SWANSON. HOW are you this
morning?
THE PRESIDENT. I'm just great. Good
to hear from you. Do you have a ques-
tion or a comment?
MR. SWANSON. Yes, kind of a mixture
of a comment and a question. My com-
ment is on, I think that oil and natural
gas should be decontrolled immediately,
all oil and natural gas. And the reason I
say this even though it might be infla-
tionary and maybe even cause a recession
immediately wouldn't it be better to get
the transfer of American dollars from the
Arab countries back towards the United
States? And this flow of dollars, wouldn't
it offset recession by increasing jobs and
reducing unemployment and plowing $40
billion back into our economy?
THE PRESIDENT. Well, obviously the in-
crease in American production is a very
good approach, but I think an immediate
decontrol of oil and natural gas would not
be well-advised.
The
Congress has passed legislation
that would let natural gas prices be de-
controlled over a fairly long period of
time, 7 or 8 years. And as a result of that
legislation, we've already had a tremen-
dous increase in both the amount of nat-
ural gas produced in the United States
and also the amount that's transported
outside the oil-producing States to States
like Georgia, Iowa, and the others further
north.
So, I think that the gradual decontrol of
natural gas and oil is a better approach.
The main thing is to let the oil companies
and the American people know that it
will be done in a carefully planned
fashion.
We have other forms of energy also to
increase. I've mentioned gasohol already,
synthetic fuels. We need to increase the
use of coal, and we can make it clean-
burning. And in addition to that, of
course, a much heavier dependence in the
future on solar power.
I hope that by 1990-well, by the year
2000, we'll have 20 percent of all the
energy being consumed in our Nation
coming directly from solar power.
MR. SWANSON. You're not ignoring
nuclear, are you?
THE PRESIDENT. No. We have a place
for nuclear power. As you know, we now
have a study going on with the Three
Mile Island incident. That report should
be to me in the next few days, and then
I will assess, as President, what we can do
to make the existing nuclear plants and
those being designed be safer and better
operated and, obviously, better designed
as well.
I might say that the whole range of
energy supplies is important, but the most
important facet is to conserve energy, not
to waste it. I think the consumption of in-
creasing quantities of energy in our coun-
try is not good for us, but whatever we
do consume we want as much as possible
to be from our own Nation.
MR. SWANSON. That's a good idea.
MR. JACKSON. The next caller is Clark
Scott from Moline, Illinois. Good morn-
ing, Clark.
MR. SCOTT. Hello.
THE PRESIDENT. Clark, go ahead.
NUCLEAR WASTE DISPOSAL
MR. SCOTT. I didn't really have a ques-
tion for you as much as I'd like to voice
my opinion on something.
THE PRESIDENT. Fine.
