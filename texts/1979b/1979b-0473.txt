Administration of Jimmy Carter, 1979
concerns. Otherwise, relations between
relations between
our two countries will inevitably be ad-
versely affected. We are seriously pursu-
ing this issue with the Soviet Union, and
we are consulting closely with the Con-
gress.
Let me emphasize that this is a sensi-
tive issue that faces our Nation, all of us,
and our Nation as a whole must respond
not only with firmness and strength but
also with calm and a sense of proportion.
This is a time for firm diplomacy, not
panic and not exaggeration. As Secretary
Vance discusses this issue with Soviet rep-
resentatives in the coming days, the Con-
gress and the American people can help
to ensure a successful outcome of these
discussions and negotiations by preserv-
ing an atmosphere in which our diplo-
macy can work.
I know I speak for the leadership in
Congress, with whom I have met this af-
ternoon, as well as for my own adminis-
tration, when I express my confidence that
our Nation can continue to show itself
to be calm and steady, as well as strong
and firm.
Thank you very
you very much.
NOTE: The President spoke at 4:15 p.m. in
