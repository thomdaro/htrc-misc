Nov. 9
Administration of Jimmy Carter, 1979
-$10 million from fiscal year 1979 and
fiscal year 1980 development assistance
funds for public works and high employ-
ment impact projects in the Caribbean.
These projects are an important part of
our fiscal year 1979-80 contributions of
$66.9 million budgeted for the Caribbean
Development Group, chaired by the
World Bank.
We are also reprogramming Food for
Peace funds to increase food assistance in
the area, especially in Nicaragua. We will
also likely be reprogramming $5 to $10
million in Foreign Military Sales credits
and International Military Education and
Training funds for the Caribbean, and
similar amounts for such programs in Cen-
tral America. We are still working out the
final details of these proposed reprogram-
mings and will fully inform the appropri-
ate congressional committees of our pro-
posed actions.
Reprogramming, however, is not
enough. The enclosed bill would provide
$80 million in flexible Economic Sup-
port funding, $75 million to assist in the
reconstruction of the Nicaraguan econ-
omy and $5 million for early-impact de-
velopment projects in other Central
American countries.
I strongly urge rapid congressional
action on this bill.
Such action will demonstrate that the
United States can be relied upon to sup-
port democratic aspirations, the rebuild-
ing of broken economies, and the security
of our friends in this nearby region. Our
additional funds for Central American
development should substantially aug-
ment existing programs. Furthermore, we
hope that other nations and international
institutions will increase their efforts to
accelerate the social and economic de-
velopment of Central America.
With your help we can make clear
where we stand.
The White House,
