Oct. 29
Administration of Jimmy Carter, 1980
people ever assembled in the United
States for any purpose, and the over-
whelming response from people of all
faiths to him and kind of an outpouring,
a demonstration of the hunger for the
characteristics of life which never change.
Things do change that cause us con-
cern, but there are some things that never
change the strength of families, basic
commitments to love, to understanding,
to compassion, to unselfishness. Those
never change.
And I'm very grateful that we live in a
country of that kind that is strong, that
can accommodate change, that can bear
inconvenience, that can marshal our
forces together when our Nation is tested..
that can put aside personal differences of
background and commitment and interest
and unite for a common purpose, that has
a system of government that can meld us
together to serve the same people, and
where our standards of morality and
ethics are the underlying, girding strength
that provides the basis for everything else
which we hope to achieve. It makes me
proud to be President of a country like
that my country and your country.
Thank you very much.
NOTE: The President spoke at 10:22 a.m. in
the Narragansett Ballroom at the Cranston
Hilton Hotel.
