Administration of Jimmy Carter, 1979
June 29
Third World, and that we have also
called the attention of the world to the
appalling refugee situation in Southeast
Asia and requested immediate action
both as to the cause and to the conse-
quences of that tragedy.
Thank you, Mr. Chairman.
PRIME MINISTER OHIRA. Thank you
very much.
Lastly, but not the least, Mr. Jenkins.
PRESIDENT JENKINS. Mr. Prime Min-
ister, ladies and gentlemen, at this stage
there is little to add, and I believe that
brevity will be more valued than any
other quality.
Like the heads of state and govern-
ment who have spoken before me, I am
glad that we have been able to concen-
trate on the challenge of the energy crisis
and agree on medium-term goals for oil
imports, as well as for conservation and
new development measures in the energy
field.
I take satisfaction in the fact that the
work done by the European Council at
Strasbourg provided such a good foun-
dation for and contribution to the results
of this summit. Here in Tokyo, the in-
dustrialized nations have, I believe, put
themselves in a better position to deal
with the inevitable damage caused to us
by scarce and expensive oil. We have done
so without forgetting the still worse, in-
deed potentially crushing impact upon
the developing countries, and we have
done so in the knowledge that we must
follow our words with action if they are
to succeed.
I add my thanks to the Emperor, to the
Prime Minister, the Government and
people of Japan for the welcome they
have given us.
PRIME MINISTER OHIRA. Thank you
very much, President Jenkins.
Ladies and gentlemen, this closes the
joint press conference.
Thank you very much for your atten-
tion.
