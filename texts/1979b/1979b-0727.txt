Federal Magistrate Act of 1979
Statement on Signing S. 237 Into Law.
October 10, 1979
I have today signed the Federal Magis-
trate Act of 1979. This act will expand
the jurisdiction of United States magis-
trates in both civil and criminal cases, and
will ensure that magistrates are appointed
on merit. It will also improve the capa-

system, while at the same time preserving
parties' rights and reducing the expense
