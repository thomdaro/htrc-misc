THE PRESIDENT. There's no way for
me to certify to that kind of thing, but in
our key spots, like the Oval Office and the
U.N. Ambassador's residence, there is a
routine sweep of the premises designed to
detect any sort of surreptitious listening
devices. And my guess is that if any nation
should try to bug the telephone or the
premises of the U.N. Ambassador, it
would be detected quite early. And there
have been no detections of any such
devices.
Q. Did you have an account of Am-
bassador Young's interview with Mr.
Terzi³ before the State Department gen-
erated through Ambassador Young an
account?
THE PRESIDENT. No.
Q. Did you have it?
THE PRESIDENT. No.
Q. In other words, our intelligence serv-
ices from whatever source had not de-
veloped, to the best of your knowledge, an
account of that meeting?
THE PRESIDENT. Well, I can't answer
that question because I don't know. I
haven't investigated that. But I did not
have an account of it.
Q. In other words, if they did, then
it had not been brought to you?
THE PRESIDENT. That's correct. And
there are many ways to get a report of a
conversation. It may be that one of the
principals involved repeated it to many
people, and those reports may have been
collected in some fashion. I think the prob-
lem with the ABC report was that you all
assumed that if a conversation was report-
ed that it had to come from listening de-
vices or bugging equipment, which is ab-
solutely not the case.

Organization observer at the United Nations.
Q. As I understand our story, we be-
lieve we had sources that told us this,
rather than just assuming it. The sources
may have been wrong. We may have
gotten it wrong. But we didn't just assume
it, sir.
THE PRESIDENT. I don't think there's
much doubt about that. The thing that
concerned us about it was that when ABC
went to the Attorney General, he denied
it absolutely with his word of honor at
stake. ABC then checked with Jody Powell
at the White House, and Jody said it was
a story that was not sound and should not
be reported. In spite of that, before the
evening broadcast ABC went with it as
though it was a fact, and that was the
thing that concerned us.
Q. I was not aware of that. I had been
told by my people-
THE PRESIDENT. I think the reporter
was named O'Brien [Timothy A. O'Brien,
ABC News], although I don't know that.
Q. —and I'd been told that in fact
before the broadcast that the Attorney
General had not spoken-I mean, Mr.
Civiletti.
THE PRESIDENT. No. I believe that
O'Brien met personally with Terry Adam-
son and Civiletti before the broadcast,
and a flat denial was made about the
accuracy of the story before the broadcast.
Q. All right. I will certainly not argue
with you, but one of us has been misin-
formed about that.
THE PRESIDENT. That's fine. I can't
certify that.
Q. What were your political soundings
yesterday in Florida, in that that's an early
primary State next year? How did you
find your own stock?
THE PRESIDENT. Well, I didn't make
any poll or anything, but I thought the
