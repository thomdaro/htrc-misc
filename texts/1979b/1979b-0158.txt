Administration of Jimmy Carter, 1979
love that crosses vast distances and also
crosses very easily the barrier of genera-
tions. Families are groups of people, some
small, some large, who do not necessarily
live together in one place, but who do
take responsibility for each other.
There is an old Yiddish proverb, "God
gave burdens, but also shoulders." Not
only our own shoulders but shoulders to
help us bear the burdens that are too
heavy for us alone, shoulders to cry on,
shoulders to be patted in a gesture of
encouragement, shoulders to help others
bear their loads and their burdens. That's
what a family is kind of a collection of
shoulders.
We're not in this alone. With strong
families, I'm convinced, as I know you
are, that our Nation's strength now and
in the future will be assured. That's a
task that I give to you to open your hearts,
to study the family structure, the struc-
ture of communities and our Nation, and
building upon strong families assure the
strength of the United States.
Thank you very much.
NOTE: The President spoke at 2:36 p.m. in
the East Room at the White House.
