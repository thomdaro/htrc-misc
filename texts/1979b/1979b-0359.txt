Administration of Jimmy Carter, 1979
Aug. 21
But I think it's good for us to try to buy
American when we can. There's no doubt
in my mind now that the automobiles
made by American manufacturers are as
good a quality and at this point are ac-
tually cheaper than some of the foreign
manufactured automobiles.
That's a good point you've made. I
hope everybody listening will try to buy
American whenever we possibly can.
MRS. GARDNER. I hope so, too, because
it would help us all in so many ways. And
I thank you, and God bless you.
THE PRESIDENT. Thank you. The same
to you.
MR. JACKSON. Our next caller is from
Moline, Illinois. This is Oscar Zepeda.
THE PRESIDENT. Oscar, go ahead. Good
morning.
MR. ZEPEDA. Good morning, Mr. Presi-
dent.
THE PRESIDENT. You have a question?
MR. ZEPEDA. Yes.
THE PRESIDENT. Ask it.
SUPPORT FOR THE PRESIDENT
MR. ZEPEDA. Okay. I just wanted to say
that I believe in you-and-
THE PRESIDENT. That's good enough.
Thank you very much.
You know, the important thing in our
country-whether you're a Democrat or a
Republican, or black or white, or speak
English or speak a foreign language, or
whether your family has been over here
for 300 years or 3 years, is to recognize
that public officials in our government
need our support. We're all in it together.
The challenges that come before us face
all of us, and the opportunities for resolv-
ing those problems and meeting those
challenges must include us all.
And it's very encouraging for a Presi-
dent to come to a place like Davenport
and to Moline, the Quad City area, and
have someone like you express your con-
fidence in me. I thank you very much. I'll
try to do you a good job.
MR. ZEPEDA. I believe you, Mr. Presi-
dent.
Is it all right if my wife and my little
girl say hi to you?
THE PRESIDENT. Of course.
MISS ZEPEDA. Hello.
THE PRESIDENT. Hello, good morning
to you.
MISS ZEPEDA. Hello, Mr. President.
THE PRESIDENT. Good morning. I'm
glad to talk to you. What's your name?
MISS ZEPEDA. Mary.
THE PRESIDENT. Mary, how old are
you?
MISS ZEPEDA. Three.
THE PRESIDENT. That's great. Well, I
wish you could come and see Amy before
we leave here. Good luck to you. Is your
mother there? Is your mother there? Can
I speak to your mother?
MISS ZEPEDA. Yes.
THE PRESIDENT. Okay.
MRS. ZEPEDA. Yes, I am.
THE PRESIDENT. Good morning to you.
You must have a wonderful family, and
I thank all of you.
MRS. ZEPEDA. Thank you.
THE PRESIDENT. Good luck, have a
good day.
MRS. ZEPEDA. You too.
MR. JACKSON. The next caller, Mr.
President, is Teresa Shima from Eldridge,
Iowa.
SOLAR HEATING
MS. SHIMA. Morning. Morning, Mr.
President.
THE PRESIDENT. Good morning.
MS. SHIMA. Okay, first of all, I'd just
like to say that I think you're doing a very
good job, and I'll be voting for you in
the next election.
