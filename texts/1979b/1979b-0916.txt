Administration of Jimmy Carter, 1979
grain awaiting shipment from Great
Lakes ports.
The backlog developed this harvest
season due to a bumper wheat crop and
unprecedented export demands, which
severely strained the Nation's grain trans-
portation system. Two months of labor
strife at the Port of Duluth in Minnesota
also disrupted grain shipments and slowed
total grain exports by as much as 10 mil-
lion bushels a week.
The White House expressed gratitude
to the Canadian Government and stated:
"We expect the additional Seaway
shipping time to help relieve the current
backlog of grain in Great Lakes ports. We
are hopeful that the weather will allow
shippers to take full advantage of the ad-
ditional time to move grain through the
Seaway."
