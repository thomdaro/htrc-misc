Administration of Jimmy Carter, 1979
MR. JACKSON. Very good. Mr. Presi-
dent, many people have sent in postcards,
wanting an opportunity to talk with you
this morning.
During the next 45 minutes, we will get
as many calls in as possible. All calls have
been preplaced. A reminder to those who
will be talking with the President: Be sure
all the radios in the vicinity of your tele-
phone are off while you're on the phone
with the President. We're using a tape
delay system that may tend to be confus-
ing to you.
Now, in order to get as many people on
the air as possible we will go straight to
the telephones.
Mr. President, the first caller is Mr.
Carl Ferrell of Rock Island, Illinois.
MR. FERRELL. This is him. Mr. Presi-
dent, how are you today?
THE PRESIDENT. Just fine, Carl. It's
good to hear from you.
MR. FERRELL. Well, it's good to talk
to you.
NATIONAL MORALE
I just want to say I think you're doing
a pretty good job, and I think it's time-
energy is a problem, of course, but I think
a bigger problem is the morale of the
American people. I think what they
should be doing is concentrating and
channeling their energies to conserving
energy and working with the government,
rather than spending all their time work-
ing against it.
THE PRESIDENT. Carl, that's a very
wise analysis. The main question that we
face now is how our Nation can be uni-
fied in the face of this energy threat.
In the past, in the history of our coun-
try, when we've had a serious challenge
like this, it's been easy for us to see it and
to recognize it, like in the First World
War, the Second World War, or even the
Great Depression. But with this energy
threat to our basic national security,
caused by our excessive dependence on
foreign oil, it's hard for the average Amer-
ican to see it or to understand it.
We import, as you know, about half
all of our oil, and there are two things we
can do about it: One is to save energy,
to eliminate waste, to conserve all we can,
and every American can help there. And
the other one is to increase American
production of energy. Oil, gas, coal, geo-
thermal-gasohol obviously would be very
important to Iowa and to Illinois-and
the increasing use of solar power.
These are the basic things that must
be done, but you're absolutely right that
people must be determined to do it. They
must be unselfish, and they must work
closely with local, State, and Federal Gov-
ernment officials and with each other.
MR. FERRELL. Well, we've got a great
nation, and the American people is a large
family, and that's what they've got to
realize. We have to work together to sur-
vive.
THE PRESIDENT. That's a very good
statement. I agree completely with you.
Thank you, Carl, very much.
MR. FERRELL. Okay. I'll let you go. I
know you've got a lot of people to talk
to you, okay?
THE PRESIDENT. Thank you.
MR. FERRELL. Okay. Have a good trip.
Bye now.
THE PRESIDENT. Goodby.
MR. JACKSON. The next caller is
Debbie Brown of Davenport. Debbie?
Ms. BROWN. Yes?
THE PRESIDENT. Go ahead, Debbie.
Ms. BROWN. Oh, hi. Who is this?
THE PRESIDENT. I think you're Debbie
Brown.
MS. BROWN. I am.
THE PRESIDENT. My name is Jimmy
Carter.
MS. BROWN. Hi.
THE PRESIDENT. Do you have a ques-
tion, Debbie?
