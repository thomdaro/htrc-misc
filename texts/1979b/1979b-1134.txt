Strategic Arms Limitation Treaty
Letter to 19 Members of the Senate.
December 17, 1979
Thank you for your letter concerning
the Senate's view of the SALT II agree-
ment. I welcome your commendation of
the statements Secretary Brown and I
have made relating to the Five Year De-
fense Program.
I have also noted your comments about
certain aspects of SALT II's terms and
about the shift in the comparative military
positions of the Soviet Union and the
United States, and your views on a num-
ber of further considerations bearing on
various aspects of the Soviet-American
relationship.
The issues you raise have been probed
in depth during the hearings before the
Senate committees, and will be further
examined in preparing for the floor de-
bate and in the course of the debate it-
self. I therefore share your interest in dis-
cussing these matters in detail with me
and members of my Administration.
I also share your desire to achieve a bi-
partisan consensus on these issues of long-
range national security strategy and arms
