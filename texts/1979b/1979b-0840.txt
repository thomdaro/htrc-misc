To Professor Allan McCleod Cormack
Congratulations! I know that all Amer-
icans join me in applauding the tribute
you have received from the Nobel Assem-
bly.
Untold numbers of persons stand to
benefit-as have thousands already-from
the advanced diagnostic procedures made
possible by your work on the theoretical
processes underlying the development of
the CAT scan. Your work has meant not
only a triumph for science but also a tri-
umph for humanitarian concerns.
It gives me great pleasure to salute you
