Sept. 27
Administration of Jimmy Carter, 1979
Americans, we must and we always will
speak out in defense of human rights at
home and everywhere in the world.
And I might add that as Americans we
must share the responsibility for, 40 years
ago, not being willing to acknowledge that
this horrible event was in prospect.
And I think that the action of this
Holocaust Commission is long overdue,
because we've not had a constant center
which could be visited by Americans of
all faiths and all races to be reminded of
our omission in the past, to have the
memory of this horrible event kept vivid
in our minds, to prevent a recurrence of
such an action anywhere on Earth in the
future.
In view of the 6 million Jewish victims
of the Holocaust, it's particularly appro-
priate that we receive this report during
the High Holy Days, just prior to Yom
Kippur, the Day of Atonement. Yom
Kippur is a day and a time for looking
back. It's a time for reflection. It's a time
for remembrance. But it's also a time for
the reaffirmation of life, a time for look-
ing ahead.
So, I will consider this report most care-
fully and will respond personally to this
Commission and to the people of our Na-
tion with my personal prayer that the
memory of the Holocaust shall be trans-
formed into a reaffirmation of life. And as
President, I can pledge to you that I will
do everything in my power to carry out
the recommendations of this report.
The Members of the Congress will be
intensely interested in arousing support
in our Legislature. And I'm sure the peo-
ple of this country will be looking with
anticipation to this reminder of the vic-
tims and also a warning that this horrible
event will never again occur on Earth.
Thank you very much, Mr. Chairman,
and all the members of the Commission.
NOTE: The President spoke at 2:15 p.m. at
the ceremony in the Rose Garden at the White
House. Prior to the ceremony, the President
met with Mr. Wiesel, Chairman of the Com-
mission, in the Oval Office.
