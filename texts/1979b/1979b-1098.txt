Nationwide Outdoor
Recreation Plan
Message to the Congress Transmitting the
Plan. December 11, 1979
To the Congress of the United States:
It is with pleasure that I transmit the
third Nationwide Outdoor Recreation
Plan to the Congress of the United States,
as required by P.L. 88-29 (16 U.S.C.
4601-1(c)). This Plan has been prepared
by the Department of the Interior to ad-
dress a number of current recreation
issues, and assess the existing supply, de-
mand, and opportunities associated with
outdoor recreation in America.
The Plan was derived from a new
involvement and leads to specific actions.
planning process which maximizes public
The rivers and trails directives issued in
my 1979 Environmental Message are
among the major decisions which orig-
inated with this Plan. Also included in the
Plan are specific actions related to Fed-
eral land acquisition policy, environ-
mental education, recreation access for
the handicapped, and energy conserva-
tion. The Urban Parks and Recreation
Recovery Program, which I proposed as
one of my urban initiatives, is already
helping to enhance close-to-home recrea-
tion opportunities, conserving energy
while meeting basic recreation needs.
all
The challenge of enhancing recreation
opportunity cannot be met by government
action alone. New partnerships among
levels of government and the private sec-
tor will be required. New ways of com-
bining resources from a variety of existing
programs must be tested to meet our Na-
tion's recreation needs.
