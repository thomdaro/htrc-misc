affected by it. The Director of the Office

quests for information by establishing a
Federal information locator system, which
will list all the types of information col-
lected by Federal agencies and will be
available for use by all agencies. This or
similar systems will not contain any infor-
mation obtained from the public. The Di-
rector shall take any other steps needed
to prevent duplication, including the as-
signment to a particular agency of lead
responsibility for the collection of certain
types of information.
(b) Seek to inform the public and
broaden public and agency comment by
preparing and publishing in the FEDERAL
REGISTER an annual paperwork calendar
of significant requests for information.
This calendar will be based on the infor-
mation contained in the agencies' paper-
work budgets.
(c) Report annually to the President
on implementation of this Order and con-
trol of the paperwork burden generally.
