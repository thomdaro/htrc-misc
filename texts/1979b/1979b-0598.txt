Legislation
Statement on Senate Approval of the
Conference Report. September 24, 1979
The Senate's approval of the confer-
ence report on the department of educa-
tion bill is a major step toward improved
government efficiency. Placing Federal
education programs in a separate depart-
ment will allow us to manage these pro-

For the past decade, the Federal Gov-
ernment has imposed a ceiling on the in-
terest rates that savers can receive on
their deposits in banks and savings insti-
tutions. Those ceilings have cost the
American people billions of dollars in lost
interest annually, and they have become
increasingly unfair to the small saver.
Especially during a period of high infla-
tion, it is simply unacceptable for the
Government to force the small saver with
a passbook account at a commercial bank
to accept a 54 percent yield when large
