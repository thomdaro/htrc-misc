July 20
Administration of Jimmy Carter, 1979
Fourth, I want to express my thanks to
those who have served and who will now
be leaving.
And fifth, I need the full support of the
American people in the future.
I am well pleased with all the changes
that have been made. Every single change
has been a positive change. There is abso-
lutely no doubt in my mind that I and my
administration will now be better able to
serve this country and to resolve those
problems and to meet those challenges
which I described to the American peo-
ple in my television address Sunday
evening.
Thank you very much.
NOTE: The President spoke at 4:17 p.m. in
the Briefing Room at the White House.
