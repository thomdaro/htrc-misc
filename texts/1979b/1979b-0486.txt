Sept. 9
Administration of Jimmy Carter, 1979
tators and all the fanatics have come and
gone, it's always the truth which remains.
It is no accident that the root meaning
of the word "martyr" is "to witness." In
Guyana and Nicaragua, these three men
were our witnesses, and they were our
martyrs. For as they died in the service of
a free press, they died in the service of us
all.
In this moment of remembrance, even
as we are repelled by the horror of their
deaths, let us recall the service of their
lives.
Whatever differences that might exist
within our own country, let us join to-
gether tonight in honor of Don Harris,
Robert Brown, Bill Stewart, and their
families, by renewing our pledge to the
standard which they upheld our com-
mon faith as Americans that it is the truth
which sets all people free.
NOTE: The President spoke at approximately
9:13 p.m. from the Oval Office at the White
House. His remarks were broadcast live dur-
ing the Academy's Emmy Awards program.

the People's Temple commune in Jonestown,
Guyana.
ABC news correspondent Bill Stewart was
killed in June 1979 while covering the civil
