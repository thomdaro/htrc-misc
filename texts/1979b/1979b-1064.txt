Nov. 30
Administration of Jimmy Carter, 1979
sure to weaken this measure by exempting
specific commodities from the reforms.
We cannot afford to accept only cosmetic
change in rail regulation.
The existing trucking and railroad
regulatory structures restrict competition,
reduce efficiency, and increase costs. It is
time for action, and I urge the Congress
to pass meaningful trucking and railroad
deregulation legislation.
NOTE: As enacted, H.R. 4440 is Public Law
96-131, approved November 30.
