tary policy, provide broader powers for
thrift institutions to compete in a modern
financial environment, and remove ob-
solete regulatory constraints.
The administration will work actively
to assure the phaseout of Regulation Q
deposit rate ceilings and the passage of
legislation to stem the decline in Federal
Reserve membership. During a period of
high inflation, it is simply unacceptable
for the Federal Government to force
small savers to accept a submarket rate of
return on their deposits. Similarly, as
Chairman Volcker and Secretary Miller
have noted, the decline in Federal Re-
serve membership ultimately threatens the
ability of our central bank to conduct
monetary policy, and it is critically im-
portant to stem membership attrition on
a fair and equitable basis.
The banking committees are to be com-
mended for their progress toward this
landmark legislation, which was outlined
in my 1979 State of the Union message.
We will work closely with the Congress to
assure the enactment of comprehensive fi-
nancial reform legislation.
NOTE: As enacted, H.R. 4998 is Public Law
96-161, approved December 28.
