China Trade Relations
Letter to the Speaker of the House and the
President of the Senate. October 23, 1979
Dear Mr. Speaker: (Dear Mr. President:)
In accordance with section 407 of the
Trade Act of 1974, I am transmitting a
copy of a proclamation extending non-
discriminatory treatment to the products
of the People's Republic of China. I also
enclose the text of the Agreement on
Trade Relations between the United
States of America and the People's Re-
public of China, which was signed on
July 7, 1979, and which is included as an
annex to the proclamation.
The Agreement on Trade Relations will
provide a nondiscriminatory framework
for our bilateral trade relations, and thus
strengthen both economic and political re-
lations between the United States and the
People's Republic of China. Conclusion of
this agreement is the most important step
