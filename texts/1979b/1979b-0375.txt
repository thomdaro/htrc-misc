cans and protect both lives and the land
that
you describe, Michael.
Thank you very much.
Q. Mr. Carter?
THE PRESIDENT. Yes.
Q. You did still not address the fact of
the farming. What happens if you have
one accident in the American farmbelt?
THE PRESIDENT. Well, obviously, it de-
pends on the kind of accident that you
have.
Q. Right. A major catastrophic acci-
dent, one which on ABC News stated the
odds in the next 30 years could be as high
as 1 in 15.
THE PRESIDENT. The only way I can
answer you is that if we have a cata-
strophic accident that would be a
catastrophe.
Q. Mr. Carter, one more point, please.
There's a great deal of talk in this coun-
try about energy independence for Amer-
ica. The Government should not forget
that Americans need energy independence
also.
AMY CARTER
Q. Mr. President, I'm Jean McKinney,
an orchestra teacher from here in Burling-
ton. And I was wondering if Amy's still
making good progress with her violin les-
sons. [Laughter]
THE PRESIDENT. I think Amy plays very
well, considering the talent that she has.
[Laughter]
I think you would be proud to hear Amy
play. She hasn't practiced much on this
trip, I have to admit. She's been concen-
have a letter that I'd like to give to you.
And I'd risk being arrested in order to
give it to you, I think it's so important.
THE PRESIDENT. No, you're not going to
be arrested. If you'll give it to my wife
Rosalynn, right there in the green shirt,
I'll get it.
Q. Thank you very much.
THE PRESIDENT. It's a pleasure.
SALE OF KEROSENE TO IRAN
Q. Mr. Carter, my name is Mary Beth
Murrell, and I'm a math teacher at West
Burlington. It's super-exciting to have you
here, and I want you to know that we
heartily support your energy program and
we're doing everything we can do to help.
We're biking to work and we installed a
solar system in our home.
THE PRESIDENT. Very good.
Q. But my question is this: On the late
news on the radio last night, they said
something about that we were selling oil
to Iran. Now, they didn't explain this at
all. They were heavily critical of the fact
that somebody was selling our oil while
you were floating down the Mississippi.
[Laughter] I would like for you to com-
plete this report and explain to me why
we are selling oil to Iran.
THE PRESIDENT. Okay.
We get from Iran, I think, about 30 mil-
lion barrels of oil every month. I'm not
sure about the exact figure, but that's
roughly what we get. And a few months
ago, because of some riots in Iran, they
sabotaged a pipeline going to the refinery
which makes kerosene for the Iranian
trating on the calliope. But she's doing people. They use kerosene in their homes
very well and I'm very proud of her.
LETTER FOR THE PRESIDENT
Q. Mr. President?
THE PRESIDENT. Yes.
Q. This is really important to me. I
like we did when I was a child to cook and
for everything else. And they had a very
severe shortage of kerosene. And they
asked us to sell them back about two-
thirds of one day's supply of kerosene to
meet the needs of the families in Iran, and
