United States Defense Policy
Remarks to Members of the Business Council.
December 12, 1979
Chairman Reg Jones, members of the
Business Council:
It's indeed a pleasure for me to be with
you again. This afternoon I would like to
make a very important statement to you,
following which the chairman and I will
walk down the hall, and I'd like to greet
each one of you individually, as has been
my custom in the past when we've been
together. And then we'll have a chance
for a few questions that you might want
to put to me concerning energy or infla-
tion or legislation before the Congress or
Iran or other matters of interest to you.
But my first concern, and the first con-
cern of every President who has ever lived
in this house, is and must be the security
of our Nation. This security rests on many
kinds of strength, on arms and also on
arms control, on military power and on
economic vitality and the quality of life
of our own people, on modern weapons,
and also on reliable energy supplies. The
well-being of our friends and our allies is
also of great importance to us. Our secu-
rity is tied to human rights and to social
justice which prevails among the people
who live on Earth and to the institutions
of international force and peace and
order which we ourselves have helped to
build.
We all hope and work and pray that we
will see a world in which the weapons of
war are no longer necessary, but now we
must deal with the hard facts, with the
world as it is. In the dangerous and uncer-
tain world of today, the keystone of our
national security is still military strength,
strength that is clearly recognized by
