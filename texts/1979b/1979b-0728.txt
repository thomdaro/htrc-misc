Administration of Jimmy Carter, 1979
the integrity of the Federal court system.
The Federal Magistrate Act of 1979 is
the first of these six measures to have
passed Congress. I ask the Congress to act
promptly on the remaining measures,
which will benefit our Federal court sys-
tem and the public.
NOTE: As enacted, S. 237 is Public Law 96-82,

Office of Federal Procurement
Policy Act Amendments of 1979
Statement on Signing S. 756 Into Law.
October 10, 1979
I have this day signed S. 756, a bill
which authorizes appropriations for the
Office of Federal Procurement Policy for
fiscal years 1980 through 1983.
In addition to its other provisions, the
legislation clarifies the authority of the
Administrator for Federal Procurement
Policy to issue policy directives for im-
proving the supply systems and processes
of the executive branch. The legislation
also calls for the development of a pro-
posal for a Uniform Procurement System
to be submitted to the Congress within 1
year. This will serve as successor to the
National Supply System project, which I
approved August 9, 1979.
NOTE: As enacted, S. 756 is Public Law 96-83,
approved October 10.
United States-Denmark
Fishery Agreement
Message to the Congress Transmitting the
Agreement. October 10, 1979
To the Congress of the United States:
In accordance with the Fishery Con-
servation and Management Act of 1976
(Public Law 94-265; 16 U.S.C. 1801),
I transmit herewith a governing interna-
tional fishery agreement between the
United States and Denmark and the
Faroe Islands, signed at Washington on
September 5, 1979.
This agreement is one of a series to be
negotiated in accordance with that legis-
lation. I urge that the Congress give fa-
vorable consideration to this agreement at
an early date. Since 60 calendar days of
continuous session, as required by the
legislation, may not be available, I rec-
ommend that the Congress consider issu-
ance of a joint resolution to bring this
agreement into force.

JIMMY CARTER
United States Travel Service
Appropriations Bill
Statement on Signing S. 233 Into Law.
October 10, 1979
I have decided to sign S. 233, which
authorizes appropriations for the United
States Travel Service.
At the beginning of the year I recom-
mended that the Service be eliminated,
for its function can and should be per-
formed by the private sector. I have not
changed my view.
I have signed S. 233, however, because
the appropriations for the Travel Service
have already been enacted as part of a
separate bill. I will work to restructure
the Federal Government's travel program
in order to conform its operation with
what I believe to be an appropriate Fed-
eral role in tourism promotion.
NOTE: As enacted, S. 233 is Public Law 96-85,
approved October 10.
