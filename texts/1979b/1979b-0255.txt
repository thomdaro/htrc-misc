Administration of Jimmy Carter, 1979

Memorandum for the Secretary of Agri-
culture, the Secretary of Commerce, the
Secretary of Housing and Urban Devel-
opment, the Secretary of Labor, the Ad-
ministrator of the Environmental Protec-
tion Agency, the Administrator of the
Small Business Administration, the Chair-
man of the Council on Environmental
Quality, the Director of the Office of
Management and Budget
In my Environmental Message of Au-
gust 2, 1979, I recognized that most
Americans benefit directly from the
healthier and more agreeable environ-
ment that results from our pollution con-
trol programs. I also noted that these pro-
grams unfortunately have been a factor
that has contributed to a limited number
of plant closures. Although there are a
number of federal assistance programs
available that can help firms avoid clo-
sure, and, when it is unavoidable, aid both
those who have lost their jobs and the
communities in which they reside, the
• Each federal agency will cooperate
closely with the Environmental Protection
Agency and with other agencies to ensure
that their various economic assistance pro-
grams are coordinated effectively.
• Each federal agency shall ensure that
it responds effectively and expeditiously to
specific adverse economic problems result-
ing from the implementation of pollution
control laws.
• Each federal agency will recommend
to me ways in which the existing assist-
ance programs should be modified, if
necessary, to enable the government to
respond more effectively to economic ad-
justment problems that may occur in the
future.
Please give these assignments your im-
mediate attention.

Therefore, I am directing each of you
together with the Council on Environ-
mental Quality and the Office of Manage-
ment and Budget to take the following
actions:
• The Environmental Protection Agen-
cy shall have responsibility to inform af-
fected parties of available assistance
where it could ease adverse effects of
pollution control laws, to notify the agen-
cies offering such assistance of impending
disruptions, and to work with both to en-
courage the effective, coordinated de-
livery of assistance; EPA shall report to
me on June 30, 1980, and annually there-
after on the agencies' efforts to coordinate
and improve the delivery of their eco-
nomic assistance programs for this
purpose.
