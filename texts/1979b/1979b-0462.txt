Aug. 31
Administration of Jimmy Carter, 1979
reception of the crowds and the public
officials and others was very good.
Q. The Governor says that you're
going to win that straw poll in November.
THE PRESIDENT. Oh, really?
Q. Now, he's a long-time supporter of
yours, if I remember right. Didn't you
support him also?
THE PRESIDENT. Not in the primary. I
didn't take any position in the primary.
But after he was nominated, of course we
supported him as a Democratic nominee,
and he is a fine Governor.
Q. Mr. President, one more question
on the Vesco matter.
ney General Bell saying, "See Spencer
Lee." Did you write such a note?
THE PRESIDENT. Yes.
Q. I don't think I know why you did
that. Could you tell me?
THE PRESIDENT. I have a very hazy
memory of it, and I've already given testi-
mony to the law enforcement agencies
about it. The report was made to me that
Spencer Lee had a report concerning
Vesco. We were trying to have Vesco ex-
tradited, and when I found that Lee had
some information about it, I wrote a note
to the Attorney General to see him.
Q. So, if there was some improper ap-
THE PRESIDENT. Yes, Bettina [Bettina proach, you did not know about it?
Gregory, ABC News].
Q. What about the charges, that there
has been some coverup, by the foreman
of the grand jury who resigned? Have you
spoken to the Attorney General or any-
body about that?
THE PRESIDENT. No. But you know any
allegation that the Attorney General of
the United States would try to cover up a
fact or a truth in the presentation to a
grand jury is obviously false. There's no
inclination to cover up anything. All we
want in any case is to have the facts come
out and to be presented in accordance
with the law. There's too much at stake
for a President or an Attorney General
deliberately to try to subvert the legal sys-
tem in our country, no matter who's in-
volved. And that's obviously a false report.
Q. We've seen those things happen in
past years. [Laughter]
THE PRESIDENT. I know that. I under-
stand that. But, you know, it would be
litically suicidal for me to permit anything
po-
of that kind or for Griffin Bell to have
done anything of that kind or for Ben
Civiletti to do anything like that. That's
something that's inconceivable.
Q. I don't think a lot of people under-
stand, if it was reported correctly, why
way back then you wrote a note to Attor-
THE PRESIDENT. No. No, I didn't.
Q. Harden did not come to you and
say, "Mr. President, it's an improper ap-
proach here" or something?
THE PRESIDENT. No.
Q. Mr. President?
THE PRESIDENT. Yes?
Q. Thank you very much.
THE PRESIDENT. Okay. Now I can walk
down the street. Thank you. I enjoyed it.
Q. Oh, by the way-the rabbits. Are
you going fishing today, sir?
THE PRESIDENT. I might. [Laughter]
Q. Are you going to take an oar?
Q. Same pond?
THE PRESIDENT. Same pond.
Q. Can you give us your version of
what happened?
Q. Yes, would you like to clear your
good name? [Laughter]
Q. Have you talked to the rabbit and
get his story?
THE PRESIDENT. I gave a report yester-
day I think that was transcribed. I don't
know if it's available to you all or not.
Q. Yeah, we got it.
THE PRESIDENT. Did you? Well, that's
accurate.
Q. It said it was a timid rabbit or a-
THE PRESIDENT. It was just a fairly
robust looking rabbit who was swimming
