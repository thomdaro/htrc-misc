Dec. 17
Administration of Jimmy Carter, 1979
These agreements are collectively referred
to herein as the "MTN agreements".
2. In accordance with sections 102 and
151 of the Trade Act of 1974 (19 U.S.C.
2112 and 2191), the MTN agreements
were submitted to Congress for its ap-
proval. Section 2 of the Trade Agree-
ments Act of 1979 (93 Stat. 147) ap-
proves the MTN Agreements and au-
thorizes the President to accept each of
the MTN agreements provided that the
President determines that all, or all but
one, of the major industrial countries (as
defined in section 126(d) of the Trade
Act of 1974 (19 U.S.C. 2136(d)) is also
accepting the agreement. If the President
determines that only one major industrial
country is not accepting an agreement,
the President may nevertheless accept
such an agreement if he determines that
the acceptance of that agreement by that
country is not essential to the effective
operation of the Agreement, and if:
(A) that country is not a major factor
in trade in the products covered
by that agreement;
(B) the President has authority to
deny the benefits of the agree-
ment to that country and has
taken steps to deny the benefits of
the agreement to that country; or
(C) a significant portion of United
States trade would benefit from
the agreement, notwithstanding
such nonacceptance, and the
President determines and reports
to the Congress that it is in the
national interest of the United
States to accept the agreement.
3. Section 2 of the Trade Agreements
Act of 1979 also provides that no agree-
ment accepted by the President shall ap-
ply between the United States and any
other country unless the President deter-
mines that such country:
(A) has accepted the obligations of the
agreement with respect to the
United States, and
(B) should not otherwise be denied the
benefits of the agreement with re-
spect to the United States because
such country has not accorded
adequate benefits, including sub-
stantially equal competitive op-
portunities for the commerce of
the United States to the extent
required under section 126(c) of
the Trade Act of 1974 (19 U.S.C.
2136(c)), to the United States.
4. Section 701 of the Tariff Act of 1930,
as amended effective January 1, 1980 (93
Stat. 151) provides that the President
must determine that certain conditions
must be met before a country can be con-
sidered a "country under the Agreement"
and, therefore, entitled to the injury de-
termination provided for in section 703
(a) and 705(b) of the Tariff Act of 1930
(93 Stat. 152 and 159).
5. Section 601 (a) of the Trade Agree-
ments Act of 1979 (93 Stat. 267) author-
izes the President to proclaim certain
modifications in the Tariff Schedules of
the United States if the President deter-
mines that the conditions under section
2(b) of the Trade Agreements Act of
1979 (93 Stat. 147) on acceptance of the
Agreement on Trade in Civil Aircraft
have been fulfilled.
Now, THEREFORE, I, JIMMY CARTER,
President of the United States of America,
acting under and by virtue of the author-
ity vested in me as President, and in con-
formity with the provisions of sections 2
and 601 (a) of the Trade Agreements Act
of 1979 (93 Stat. 147 and 267), herein
referred to as "the Act", section 701 of
the Tariff Act of 1930, as amended effec-
tive January 1, 1980 (93 Stat. 151), and
2254
