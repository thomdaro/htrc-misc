Over more than a decade, the WHO
brought together in a sustained battle
against smallpox a group of experts,
health workers, and political officials from
countries throughout the many regions
where the disease was endemic. The
leader of that WHO effort was Dr. Don-
ald A. Henderson, who was then an officer
of the U.S. Public Health Service working
with the WHO. Henderson and his suc-
cessors at the Center for Disease Control
were imaginative and dedicated Ameri-
can contributors to this worldwide success.
In addition to eradicating what was
long one of the most dread diseases known
to mankind, this global campaign has pro-
duced financial savings for the United
States. We invested an estimated $27 mil- James Rentschler, NSC staff member
lion over the many years that some 300
persons from the Public Health Service
filled assignments overseas related to
smallpox control, and in direct financial
assistance from AID and HEW. Now, rou-
tine smallpox vaccination is no longer nec-
essary in this country, and there is no risk
of smallpox to American travelers
abroad. The $27 million investment is re-
turned every 3 months in savings.
