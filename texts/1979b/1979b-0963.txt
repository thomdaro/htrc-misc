Emergency Energy Conservation
Act of 1979
Remarks on Signing S. 1030 Into Law.
November 5, 1979
THE PRESIDENT. This is a very good occa-
sion in the evolution of an acceptable
energy policy for our country. We face at
all times the possibility of an emergency
shortage, a very severe reduction in sup-
plies of gasoline and diesel fuel for the
transportation of the people of America.
And I want to thank very much the key
Members of the House and Senate-
there's no way to name them all-who've
been instrumental in passing this Emer-
gency Energy Conservation Act of 1979,
quite often referred to as the gas rationing
bill.
