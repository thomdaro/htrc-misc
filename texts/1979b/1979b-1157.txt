Price Controls on Heavy
Crude Oil
White House Statement. December 21, 1979
The President today acted to lift price
controls from expanded volumes of heavy
crude oil production. By signing an
amendment to Executive Order 12153,
the President decontrolled, effective im-
mediately, heavy crude oil with an aver-
age specific gravity up to 20.0° API. In
taking this action today, the President
expressed his deep appreciation to Senator
Cranston and the California delegation
for their assistance in this effort.
This action follows a Presidential direc-
tive to the Department of Energy at the
time Executive Order 12153 was signed
(August 17, 1979). That order decon-
trolled heavy crude oil production below
16.0° API. The President asked DOE to
review and hold public hearings on the
advisability of expanding the definition of
heavy crude oil above the 16.0° level. The
action taken today responds to the find-
ings and recommendations made by DOE
as a result of the hearing and review
process.
Both Executive Order 12153 and the
amendment signed today apply only to
current production of heavy crude oil or
production from known reservoirs. Newly
discovered supplies of heavy crude are
covered under the President's April 5,
1979, decision to decontrol this category
of oil effective June 1, 1979.
It is expected that decontrol of oil in
the 16.0°-20.0° range will significantly
accelerate production of this resource and
will yield approximately 140 million bar-
rels of additional supplies between now
and 1986. Daily production should in-
crease by about 65,000 barrels per day in
1981, and peak at an added 130,000 bar-
rels per day in 1983.
The President does not recommend
that oil in the 16.0°-20.0° range be
exempt from the windfall profits tax, as
he did for heavy crude oil below 16.0°
API. The extra incentives provided by
the decontrol action itself are sufficient to
generate added production as well as to
prevent heavy oil wells in this range from
being shut in, because they are only mar-
ginally economic or uneconomic under
price controls.
