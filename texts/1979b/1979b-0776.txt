Administration of Jimmy Carter, 1979
Ms. STAMBERG. Good. Let's take an-
other call now. This is from Elizabeth
Gamble, in Everett, Washington. Mrs.
Gamble, go ahead, please; you're on the
line with President Carter.
PRESIDENTIAL TERMS OF OFFICE
MRS. GAMBLE. Hello, Mr. President.
THE PRESIDENT. Hello, Elizabeth. Go
ahead.
Ms. STAMBERG. Go ahead.
MRS. GAMBLE. Hello, Mr. President.
THE PRESIDENT. Hello, I hear you very
well.
MRS. GAMBLE. I'm honored to be
called. Now my question is this: What do
you think of one 6-year term for the
Presidency instead of two 4-year terms?
Under the present law, a President is
forced to spend time and energy in the
first term working for reelection-unfor-
tunately, this year, sooner than usual.
THE PRESIDENT. I agree with you.
MRS. GAMBLE. Good.
THE PRESIDENT. Since I've been in this
office, I've become more and more con-
vinced that one 6-year term would be
better. We have too much of an emphasis
by the news media, in my opinion, on
political motivations of a President, al-
most as soon as a President takes office.
And I've seen and talked to and studied
the situation where other Presidents in
countries in this hemisphere, like Mexico
and Venezuela, for instance, have one 6-
year term. I think they're much more
likely not only to act in a nonpolitical basis
or a nonpartisan way but also to have the
recognition among people, including the
news media, that when they do take a dif-
ficult stand or do make a public state-
ment or take action, that it is not politi-
cally motivated.
And I think the injection of politics so
early in the election year-already, as a
matter of fact-is unfortunate.
MRS. GAMBLE. Well, that is my opin-
ion. Do you think that there's any possi-
bility of there ever being the law ever
being changed?
THE PRESIDENT. I think it's quite re-
mote, because it requires a tremendous
and concerted effort all over the Nation
to make a change in the U.S. Constitu-
tion. And I don't see the issue being so
sharply of interest to American people
that this high motivation would ever be
marshaled any time in the near future.
MRS. GAMBLE. Well, I don't wish to
take up too much time, but before closing,
I wish to say I think that Rosalynn is the
ideal American woman.
THE PRESIDENT. I know she's the ideal
wife. Thank you very much.
MRS. GAMBLE. Thank you, Mr.
President.
MS. STAMBERG. Thank you, Mrs.
Gamble.
On the line now, from Fairbanks, Alas-
ka, Mr. President-
THE PRESIDENT. Very good.
Ms. STAMBERG.-is John Jacques.
Go head, Mr. Jacques.
ALASKAN PUBLIC LANDS
MR. JACQUES. Yes. Good morning, Mr.
President, how you doing this morning?
THE PRESIDENT. Good morning. I hear
you perfectly well. I'm glad to hear from
you.
MR. JACQUES. Well, Mr. President, I
have an Alaskan question to ask you. With
your imposition of the Antiquities Act and
the National Monuments a year ago, you
have locked up a few acres, matter of fact,
millions of acres of land here in Alaska,
taken this control away from the State
government-
THE PRESIDENT. No, that's not-
MR. JACQUES. I was-
