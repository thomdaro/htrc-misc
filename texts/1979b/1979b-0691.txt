activities during the six-month period
ending October 1, 1979. This Report is
provided to the Congress in conformity
with Section 4 of the Public Law 94-110

The Peace Treaty which Egypt and Is-
rael signed in Washington on March 26,
1979 calls for the United States to con-
tinue monitoring responsibilities in the Si-
nai until January 25, 1980, when Israeli
armed forces withdraw from areas east of
the Giddi and Mitla Passes. This mission
will be completed on schedule.
Trilateral talks in Washington on Sep-
tember 18 and 19 resulted in tentative
agreement for the United States, using
the Sinai Field Mission, to verify force lev-
els specified in Annex I of the Treaty, in
the area of the Sinai west of the Interim
Buffer Zone. Administration officials have
been in touch with appropriate Congres-
sional committees on various aspects of
the U.S. undertaking and will provide
Congress with all agreements and under-
standings to which the United States is a
party.
