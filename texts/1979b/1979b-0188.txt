ragua, Lawrence A. Pezzullo, will return
to Managua on Saturday's flight. He will

of Americans for the hunger and distress
of the Nicaraguan people after many
months of devastating conflict.

75 percent has already been delivered, and
the remaining 2,500 pounds of U.S.-

ing in Nicaragua this weekend on a spe-
