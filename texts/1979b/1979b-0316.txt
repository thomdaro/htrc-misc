Administration of Jimmy Carter, 1979
Privacy Act of 1974
Letter to the Speaker of the House and the
President of the Senate Transmitting a Report.
August 16, 1979
Dear Mr. Speaker: (Dear Mr. Presi-
dent:)
This letter forwards the Fourth An-
nual Report of executive branch activities.
covered by the Privacy Act of 1974. The
report reaffirms this Administration's
commitment to protecting individual pri-
vacy, illustrates steps taken to achieve
this goal, and outlines agency activities in
administering the Privacy Act during
1978.
I hope you will take this record of our
progress into account as you consider the
Administration's legislative proposals on
individual privacy. This report not only
documents how far we have come since
the passage of the Privacy Act, but how
important personal privacy is to this
Administration.
Sincerely,
JIMMY CARTER

dressed to Thomas P. O'Neill, Jr., Speaker of
