ments identified in the third recital of this

9. Following unsatisfactory negotiations
with the European Economic Community
under Articles XXIV: 6 and XXVIII of
the General Agreement regarding the
maintenance by the European Economic
Community of unreasonable import re-
strictions upon imports of poultry from the
United States, the President, by Procla-
mation 3564 of December 4, 1963 (77
Stat. 1035), suspended certain United
States tariff concessions; as a result of the
reciprocal concessions contained in the
Geneva (1979) Protocol to the General
Agreement, I determine that the termi-
nation of such suspension of tariff con-
cessions contained in Proclamation 3564
(except those applicable to automobile
trucks valued at $1,000 or more (pro-
vided for in TSUS item 692.02)) is re-
quired to carry out the General Agree-
ment.
