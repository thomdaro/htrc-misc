The next caller is in Jacksonville, Flor-
ida. It's Mrs. Carol A. Whitcomb. Go
ahead, Mrs. Whitcomb, you're on the line
with President Carter.
ADDRESSING THE PRESIDENT
that
MRS. WHITCOMB. President Carter?
THE PRESIDENT. Good morning.
MRS. WHITCOMB. I just want to say
this is really an honor to talk to you, and
I'm so thrilled. I want to tell you also, I
went down to Tampa on August 30 to see
you, and I really enjoyed your speech. But
my question is really a complaint about
the news media, how they always tend to
call
you Mr. Carter. And to me, I think
they should show you the respect that is
due to you by calling you President Car-
ter. And that is really the only thing I
have to say except that I just wanted to
talk to you.
THE PRESIDENT. Well, thank you very
much, Carol. I hope I can meet you per-
sonally sometime.
MRS. WHITCOMB. I hope so, too, Presi-
dent Carter. And also, is there any way I
can get a letter saying that I talked to you,
so I can have it to show to my children?
THE PRESIDENT. Well, there are liter-
ally hundreds of thousands of people lis-
tening to us, and I will also write you a
letter.
MRS. WHITCOMB. Thank you, sir, I
really appreciate it.
THE PRESIDENT. Let me comment on
your comment, first of all, before we quit.
I hope you don't forget to go to the cau-
cuses today; everybody in Florida ought to
participate.
When Washington became the first
President, there was a move made to give
him some sort of title, and he objected to
this. And there was some doubt about how
he should be addressed during his term
of office, and also John Adams. When
Thomas Jefferson became President, he
insisted that everyone call him "Mr.
Jefferson."
And so, I don't have any objection to
that. The President ought not to be hon-
ored any more than just being able to
hold the office, and so "President Carter"
or "Mr. President" is also very good. And
when I drive down the streets-for in-
stance, recently in Tampa for a townhall
meeting—and the children and everybody
yell "Hi, Jimmy," I also am thrilled by
the friendship. But I think "Mr. Carter"
or "President Carter" are both appro-
priate.
Ms. STAMBERG. Thanks very much,
Mrs. Whitcomb.
The next call comes from Jerry John-
son, and he's calling from Flint, Mich-
igan. Go ahead, Mr. Johnson, you're on
the line with President Carter.
STRATEGIC ARMS LIMITATION
MR. JOHNSON. Good afternoon, Mr.
President.
THE PRESIDENT. Good afternoon,
Jerry.
MR. JOHNSON. How are you?
THE PRESIDENT. Fine.
MR. JOHNSON. Okay, I have a question
here concerning the SALT treaty.
THE PRESIDENT. Okay.
MR. JOHNSON. All right. If it's rejected
by the Senate—and I know there's doubts
right now-what are your future options
