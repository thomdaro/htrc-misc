Veto of a Petroleum Price Review Bill.
July 21, 1975
To the House of Representatives:
I am returning without my approval H.R. 4035, the Petroleum Price Review
Act, because it would increase petroleum consumption, cut domestic production,
increase reliance on insecure petroleum imports and avoid the issue of phasing
out unwieldy price controls.
H.R. 4035 would go counter to the Nation's need to conserve energy and re-
duce dependence on imported oil. It would increase petroleum imports by about
350,000 barrels per day in 1977, compared to import levels under my phased
decontrol plan. It would even increase imports by about 70,000 barrels per day
over continuation of the current system of mandatory controls through 1977.
The provisions in this bill to roll back the price of domestic oil not now con-
trolled, to repeal the "stripper well" exemption from price controls and to es-
tablish a three-tier price system which would require even more complex reg-
ulations would be counterproductive to the achievement of energy inde-
pendence.
The bill does contain an Administration requested provision which would
continue the coal conversion program through December 31st. Since coal con-
version authorities authorized last year in the Energy Supply and Environmen-
tal Coordination Act expired June 30th, I urge rapid enactment of a simple
one year extension of these authorities.
Last Wednesday, July 16, I submitted to Congress a compromise plan to phase
out price controls on crude oil over a thirty-month period. Coupled with admin-
istratively imposed import fees, this plan will reduce the Nation's imports by
900,000 barrels per day by 1977. It will reduce our vulnerability to another em-
bargo by adding slightly over one cent per gallon to the price of all petroleum
products by the end of 1975 and seven cents by 1978.
If Congress acts on this compromise and on other Administration proposed
energy taxes, including the "windfall profits" tax and energy tax rebates to
consumers, the burden of decontrol will be shared fairly, and our economic
recovery will continue.
I veto H.R. 4035, because it increases our vulnerability to unreliable sources
of crude oil and does not deal with the need to phase-out rigid price and alloca-
