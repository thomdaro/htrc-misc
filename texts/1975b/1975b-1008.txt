Special Message to the Congress Reporting on Budget
Rescissions and Deferrals. December 1, 1975
[Dated November 29, 1975. Released December 1, 1975]
To the Congress of the United States:
In accordance with the Impoundment Control Act of 1974, I herewith propose
13 new rescissions totalling $838.6 million in budget authority. In addition, I
am reporting 18 new deferrals that total $253.2 million in budget authority and
changes to one deferral previously transmitted that decrease the budget authority
deferred by $4.1 million.
If we are to avoid excessive Federal spending, the kinds of actions I am pro-
posing today are essential. I believe that both the legislative and executive
branches must continually weigh the contribution made by each Federal pro-
gram against the limited resources available. We must carefully assess new or
expanded activities before they are implemented. To make room for necessary
new spending, we must eliminate Federal spending for programs that are no
longer needed, that duplicate other programs, or that can be financed from
other sources.
The details of each rescission proposal and deferral are contained in the at-
tached reports.
The White House,
November 29, 1975.
GERALD R. FORD
NOTE: The attachments detailing the rescissions and deferrals are printed in the Federal Register of Decem-
ber 4, 1975 (40 FR 56803).
