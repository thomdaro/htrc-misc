Gerald R. Ford, 1975
More sophisticated cash management practices throughout Government and
cutbacks in some Government programs that contributed sizeable balances have
caused the decline.
This anniversary date is an appropriate occasion for all of us to renew our
efforts to support this important program. I urge you to examine what new
approaches, consistent with good cash management, you can take to further
the program.
I have asked the Secretary of the Treasury to review your regular quarterly
reports and to advise me on our progress.

Statement on a United Nations Draft Resolution Concerning
Zionism. October 24, 1975
IT HAS BEEN a general principle of the United States to take grave exception
to any action that weakens the United Nations as an effective forum for the
peaceful resolution of international disputes.
We deplore in the strongest terms the recent vote in the Social Committee
characterizing Zionism as a form of racism. Such action undermines the prin-
ciples upon which the United Nations is based.
The spokesmen for the United States in the United Nations have expressed
well and forcefully the views of this Administration and the American people
on this issue.

ON THIS Veterans Day, we pay special and appropriate tribute to the men
and women who put their lives on the line for their country-those who served

preservation of freedom and honor them for their courage and devotion to
country.
