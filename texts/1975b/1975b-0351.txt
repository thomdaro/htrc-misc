Gerald R. Ford, 1975

leadership in working with Secretary Kissinger and with the Israelis, all of us
are most grateful for.

President Sadat. Hello? President Ford is speaking?
PRESIDENT FORD. Yes. I can hear you, Mr. President. I hope you can hear me,
Mr. President.

PRESIDENT FORD. I don't hear too well, Mr. President.
PRESIDENT SADAT. President Ford speaking?
PRESIDENT FORD. Yes, this is President Ford.
PRESIDENT SADAT. Go ahead, please.

hear your comments, Mr. President.
Let me say, if I might, despite the difficulties, that Mrs. Ford and I hope that
Mrs. Sadat and you and your children will visit the United States sometime

Secretary Kissinger has told me of the very warm hospitality that you have
extended to him and Mrs. Kissinger, and we look forward to reciprocating when
you come to the United States in the fall of 1975.
I regret that I can't hear. The connection is very bad. I hope that you can
hear me and my comments from the United States.
Mr. President, I understand that Secretary Kissinger is coming to Alexandria
to personally deliver the document for your initialing, and I have asked Henry
to extend to you on that occasion the gratitude and appreciation of the American
people for your patience, your leadership, and your understanding of the need
and necessity for a forward step, and important step in the ultimate aim of total
peace in the Middle East.
PRESIDENT SADAT. Hello?
PRESIDENT FORD. Hello, Mr. President.
PRESIDENT SADAT. Hello, Mr. President.
PRESIDENT FORD. I can hear you better now, sir.
PRESIDENT SADAT. Mr. President, I hope you and your family are well.
PRESIDENT FORD. I am feeling very well, Mr. President, and I hope you are, too.
PRESIDENT SADAT. I want to thank you for your personal message. [Inaudible]
