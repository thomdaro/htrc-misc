would have distributed benefits on an equitable basis. This reform was rejected
by the Congress. Had it been approved, a savings of $1 billion in fiscal year 1976
at the current rate of participation would have resulted.
In submitting this revised budget request, made necessary by the existing law,
I once again ask the Congress to work with me on needed changes. We must
work toward two goals:
-In fairness to those truly in need, we must focus food stamp assistance on
them;
-In fairness to the overburdened taxpayers who must pay the bills, we must
tighten eligibility and participation requirements.
More than 70 members of the Congress already have joined in supporting leg-
islation which would recognize the need for changes in the Food Stamp Act.
Their proposal would concentrate resources on assistance to low-income Ameri-
cans and relate the Food Stamp program to other assistance programs directed
toward these same families. It would introduce a number of positive objectives
which should be supported by everyone who shares the desire to assist those
truly in need and to control costs.
I urge in the strongest terms possible that the Congress begin hearings on
these proposals at the earliest possible date. If this program is to be contained,
even within its current bounds action must be taken immediately.

last session of the 93rd Congress, H.R. 14214 and H.R. 17085. In my memo-
randums of disapproval, dated December 23, 1974, and January 3, 1975, re-
