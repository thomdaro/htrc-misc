Gerald R. Ford, 1975
surveillance here as a spy ship. I convinced them that I wouldn't go along with
that, that we were just a commercial operation. We had no warfare or combat
materiel-rifles, ammunition, and bombs. We had no electronic surveillance
equipment aboard.
THE PRESIDENT. Those American planes looked pretty good to you?
CAPTAIN MILLER. Those American planes looked like angels coming out of
the sky.
THE PRESIDENT. I bet it was good to see these fellows when you saw them on
board.
CAPTAIN MILLER. Yes, sir. I boarded the ship at 12:05, and I walked up to the
bridge and all the men were up there. And they were telling me what happened
as we got underway, or under tow-the destroyer escort towed us.
THE PRESIDENT. What does the ship's log say? I used to be the assistant navi-
gator on a carrier out there in the Pacific, and part of my job, along with the
quartermaster, was to keep the ship's log. Was there a vacant space in there
from the time you were boarded until you all got on board?
SEAMAN. Right, one space.
THE PRESIDENT. It would be nice to have a copy of the ship's log the day
that it all happened and a copy of the ship's log the day that you all boarded
it and you all got back home.
CAPTAIN MILLER. We can give you a copy of the log, Mr. President. We can
also give you a copy of our charts and all the navigation reports that we had
on it.
THE PRESIDENT. That would be very interesting.
What kind of a ship is the SS Greenville?
SEAMAN. It is a victory ship, 21 years old.
THE PRESIDENT. It is a Government-owned one?
SEAMAN. Yes, sir, U.S.S. Greenville CAK 237.
THE PRESIDENT. You all are part of the civil service crew that operates it.
Where did they find you all?
SEAMAN. We were part of the refugee operations in Saigon and Cam Ranh
and Danang. We were on standby.
THE PRESIDENT. In the Philippines? They picked you up by helicopter?
SEAMAN. Yes, in Manila Bay.
REPORTER. Was a report on the Mayaguez turned in to the White House?
Is a report on the operation to be made public?
