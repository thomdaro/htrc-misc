Public Papers of the Presidents
1. Reduce costs by more than $1.2 billion per year.
2. Limit eligibility to those whose gross income less the standard deduction
is below the poverty level ($5050 for a family of four).
3. Make the program more realistic by measuring actual income over the
preceding 90 days for purposes of eligibility determinations, rather than esti-
mating future income, and requiring recipients to report their financial status
on a monthly basis.
4. Increase benefits only for those at the very lowest income level.
5. Eliminate legal abuses and cut the cost of administration by replacing cur-
rent variable and complex deductions with a standard deduction of $100 a
month.
6. Set a standard deduction of $125 a month for households with elderly
members.
7. Establish a minimum age for qualification as a separate household.
8. Require able-bodied recipients to seek, accept and retain gainful employ-
ment.
9. Eliminate categorical eligibility for recipients of public assistance.
10. Require any family which receives food stamps to spend 30 percent of
household income for the stamps.
These proposed changes are based on extensive review by Executive Depart-
ments involved in administering and supervising the Food Stamp program and
on consultations with a bipartisan coalition of members of the Senate and House
of Representatives concerned with Food Stamp abuses. They are essential to real
reform.
The need to control the growth and abuse of the Food Stamp program is
broadly recognized.
What we need now is action by Congress.
