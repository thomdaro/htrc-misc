Public Papers of the Presidents
tion for July 24, 1975. The point that I think significant is the following: Our
forefathers for almost 200 years have prayed, regardless of their beliefs or their
faith, and this has helped them, and they are doing it today as they have in the
past.
But equally significant, it has been the prayers of our forefathers, as it is the
prayers of our fellow countrymen today, that have made America strong. And I
am convinced, as we move ahead, individual prayer will help not only the
person but the country, and prayer today means as much to Americans as it did
on June 12, 1775.
And I thank you very, very much for this beautiful collection. This is a beauti-
ful collection, and I thank you on behalf of the Presidency and thank you again,
all the people who are here representing the various faiths in America.
NOTE: The President spoke at 12:55 p.m. in the Oval
Office at the White House. Peter P. Stewart, presi-
dent of the Thanksgiving Square Foundation, pre-
sented him with the first collection of 181 day-of-
prayer proclamations issued by Presidents and Con-
gresses since 1775, when the first National Day of
Prayer was proclaimed by the Second Continental
Congress.
On June 12, 1975, the President signed Proclama-
tion 4379, proclaiming July 24 as National Day of
Prayer, 1975.

Remarks on Greeting the 1975 Wimbledon Tennis
Champions. July 21, 1975
WE ARE real honored to have the two Wimbledon championsâ€”Arthur Ashe
and Billie Jean King. We are pleased to have them in the White House. They
represent the excellence in athletics in the field of tennis.
I just told them I watched them both on television and envied their com-
petence and regretted that I could only watch and not participate.
We are proud of them and delighted to have them back after having done
such a first-class job.
We are glad to have you.
NOTE: The President spoke at 3:10 p.m. in the Rose
Garden at the White House. Mrs. King won the
women's singles title and Mr. Ashe, the men's
singles title at the 1975 tournament held in Wimble-
don, England, from June 23 to July 5.
