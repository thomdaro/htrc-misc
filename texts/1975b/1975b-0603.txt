making it something meaningful to the young people as well as a couple of
older ones.
The Bicentennial should be a great year in the United States. We have to
show what we have done for 200 years in order to give inspiration to the young
people to do what they have to do in the third century of this country. They
have an obligation, just as their forefathers had, and I have great faith in the
young people today represented by this group that they will do as well, if not
better, than we did.
MR. HAMMOND. I hope so.
THE PRESIDENT. Thank you very, very much.
MR. HAMMOND. Now, this is Mr. Nathan Kaye. He is connected with the
Hopkinton Bicentennial Commission. As a matter of fact, he is the one that
contacted our office and made this day possible.
MR. KAYE. Mr. President, the Hopkinton, Rhode Island, Town Council and
its Happy Bicentennial America Committee are greatly honored to present to
you this song, "Happy Bicentennial America.‚Äù Thanks to you and anticipating
the help of the American Revolution Bicentennial Administration, we hope
that this song will be sung by our citizens loudly and proudly. Happy Bicen-
tennial America.
THE PRESIDENT. Thank you very much, sir. Can I hear the song?
MR. KAYE. Yes, sir. They are going to sing it.
[At this point, a group of Hopkinton schoolchildren sang the Bicentennial song.]
MR. KAYE. Mr. President, he has a tape recording of the song.
THE PRESIDENT. Thank you, thank you very, very much, sir. Can I have my
picture taken with all of these children?
MR. KAYE. Sure.
THE PRESIDENT. Thank you very much. It has been a pleasure. It is a nice
way to start a Saturday morning.
NOTE: The exchange began at 8:45 a.m. in the Rose
Garden at the White House. Mr. Hammond was
president of the Hopkinton Town Council, and
Mr. Kaye was secretary of the Hopkinton Bicenten-
nial Commission.
