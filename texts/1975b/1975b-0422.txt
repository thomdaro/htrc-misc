Public Papers of the Presidents
compromise fail, I will act to ensure an orderly transition from government
controls to the free market.
Resolution of the oil price controls issue is an essential first step toward a
total energy independence program. We must have a national energy program
before we have a national energy emergency.
Our time to act instead of react grows shorter with each day. I urge Members
of the Senate and the House to sustain this veto and get on with the job of
meeting this problem head-on.
The continued failure of Members of Congress to enact a national energy
program puts us increasingly at the mercy of foreign oil producers and will
certainly result in Americans paying substantially higher prices for their fuel.
Thank you.
NOTE: The President spoke at 1:58 p.m. in the Oval Office at the White House. The remarks were recorded
for later use on radio and television.

Veto of a Bill To Extend Domestic Oil Price Controls.
September 9, 1975
To the Senate of the United States:
I am today vetoing S. 1849, which would extend price controls on domestic
oil another six months. I am taking this action because:
1. An extension of price controls would increase our dangerous and growing
dependence on imported oil.
2. It would increase the export of jobs and dollars from our economy.
3. It would jeopardize our future economic stability and national security.
4. It would retard conservation of energy.
5. It would postpone the badly needed development and production of new
domestic energy.
6. It would negate the possibility of long-range compromise on this problem
because of expected Congressional reluctance to tackle the issue of higher oil
prices in an election year.
Since 1971, America's bill for imported oil has climbed from just over $3
billion annually to $25 billion today-a 700% increase. This $25 billion could
provide more than one million jobs for Americans here at home. We cannot
delay longer.
