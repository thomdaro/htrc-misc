Letter to the Speaker of the House and the President of the
Senate Transmitting Proposed Automobile Emission
Standards Legislation. July 28, 1975
[Dated July 26, 1975. Released July 28, 1975]
ON JUNE 27, 1975, I transmitted a special message to the Congress which
described the complex problem of setting automobile emission standards which
strike the best possible balance among our air quality, public health, energy,
consumer cost and other economic objectives.
As indicated in that message, I have concluded that automobile emission
standards should not be more rigid than those applied to 1975 and 1976 model
cars because more rigid standards unnecessarily would increase car prices, reduce
gasoline mileage, and increase energy demands. There is also the potential that
tighter standards would require emission controls that result in new pollutants
with serious health impact.
I am enclosing a draft of a bill which would implement the recommenda-
tions described in detail in my June 27th message. I urge prompt passage of
this bill.
Sincerely,
NOTE: This is the text of identical letters addressed to
the Honorable Carl Albert, Speaker of the House of
GERALD R. FORD
Representatives, and the Honorable Nelson A.
Rockefeller, President of the Senate.
