natural resource so we can have more productivity, more jobs, and a better
country.
But as I said, the Congress has done nothing, even though common sense says
it must be done and public opinions recently show a growing popular support
for deregulation. Further delay is intolerable. Even if the Congress should act
this session, it will still be one or more winters before we could feel the beneficial
results of that action.
I am delighted to be here. I just had a wonderful experience over in Pekinâ€”
the dedication of the Everett Dirksen Research Center. I am delighted to hear

free and prosperous America we all want and believe in.
Freedom, in my judgment, is more than a word. It is a way of life, a vital,

together to make some reason and rationale out of the sometimes conflicting
interests of a great need for additional energy and still the great desire to protect
our environment.
I recall very vividly some discussions we had in December about what the
auto emission standards should be. And we worked it out, and I want to com-
pliment both Frank and Russ for doing it. Of course, we subsequently had a
report that put a different light on the situation. But what I am trying to illustrate
is that we have people in this Administration who have positions of responsibility,
