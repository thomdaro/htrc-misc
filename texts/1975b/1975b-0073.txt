Statement on the Interagency Task Force for Indochina.
July 21, 1975
I AM today formally announcing the transfer of principal operational responsi-
bility of the Interagency Task Force for the resettlement of refugees from Indo-
china from the Department of State to the Department of Health, Education,
and Welfare.
Since I formed the Task Force in April, the resettlement of refugees has be-
come primarily a domestic rather than foreign affairs concern. A great deal has
been accomplished in evacuating, caring for, and resettling refugees from Indo-
china. However, much remains to be done. I ask all Americans to open their
hearts to these refugees as we have to others throughout our history.
Mrs. Julia Taft, Deputy Assistant Secretary of Health, Education, and Wel-
fare, who has been acting as Director of the Task Force since the departure of
Ambassador Dean Brown, will continue as Director. All decisions and activities
regarding the domestic and international resettlement of refugees from Indo-
china will be coordinated by her. She will act under my direction and in close
coordination with the Secretary of Health, Education, and Welfare and the
President's Advisory Committee on Refugees. Mrs. Taft's responsibilities will
continue to involve numerous governmental departments, and I am directing
each of them to offer her their full cooperation and support in this important
task.

LET ME first welcome you, Mr. Stewart, and all of you representing different
faiths and creeds and beliefs. I thank you very, very much for this collection,
which will be a significant part of the White House memorabilia.
I didn't realize until I talked to you and read some material on it, but there
have been proclamations issued either by a congress or the Congress and by the
President since June 12, 1775. I was delighted, of course, to issue the proclama-
