Special Message to the Congress Reporting on Budget Deferrals.
October 20, 1975
To the Congress of the United States:
In accordance with the Impoundment Control Act of 1974, I herewith report
eight new deferrals totalling $16.1 million in budget authority. In addition, I am
transmitting two supplementary deferrals that increase amounts previously re-
ported by $18.6 million.
The eight new deferrals are for programs of the Department of Health,
Education, and Welfare. These deferrals establish, for the programs reported,
funding levels that differ from the general levels allowed by the continuing
resolution. The Congress is now in the process of substituting the several uni-
form funding levels set by the continuing resolution with funding levels for
each program. The new deferrals I am reporting preserve the possibility of
conducting the reported programs in 1976 at the levels I have recommended
and, in one case, at the level the Senate has recommended.
The details of all ten deferrals are contained in the attached reports.
The White House,
October 20, 1975.
GERALD R. FORD
NOTE: The attachments detailing the deferrals are printed in the Federal Register of October 23, 1975 (40
FR 49741).

Statement on the United States-Soviet Union Agreement on
Grain Sales. October 20, 1975
THE AMERICAN peopleâ€”our many grain-farming communities, our work-
ers, our farmers, and our consumers-will benefit from the agreement signed in
Moscow today providing for regular and orderly sales of wheat and corn to the
Soviet Union during the next 5 years. Under this agreement, the Soviet Union
has committed to purchase 6 million metric tons of grain per year representing
$1 billion in annual export earnings. Accordingly, I am today terminating the
temporary suspension of sales of grain to the Soviet Union.
