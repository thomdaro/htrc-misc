Remarks on Greeting the Captain of the SS Mayaguez
and Crewmembers of the U.S.S. Greenville.
July 24, 1975
IT IS great to have you here, and let me thank you very much. You all were
just tremendous.
Believe me, it is of great significance not only to the American people but I
think its significance goes well beyond that to the world as a whole. I want to
congratulate you, Captain Miller, and through you my congratulations to the
crew who were so strong and so resourceful.
The American people are proud of every one of you. You did a wonderful

and maybe longer, because it, to me, was a very significant incident that has had
very broad and, I think, tremendous impact not only on our people but people
around the world.
You look pretty healthy. How badly did they treat you?
CAPTAIN MILLER. They didn't treat us badly. They treated us fairly well. We
didn't get much sleep.
The President. Did they do anything to the ship when they made you get off
of it?
CAPTAIN MILLER. Some of the rooms were locked, and they kept them all in
rooms on the ship. They locked the seamen in their quarters. They felt we had
