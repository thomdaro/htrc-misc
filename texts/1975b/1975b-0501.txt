Gerald R. Ford, 1975
uniqueness is that we wrote into our first great document the inalienable right
of the pursuit of happiness.
In that pursuit, Americans have dreamed big dreams, taken great risks—some-
times failed miserably and sometimes succeeded magnificently. But always,
whether successful or otherwise, they took it with courage and determination.
The men and women to whom this museum is dedicated lived and enjoyed
that freedom to the fullest. The spirit of enterprise and daring this museum
records in the petroleum industry must be kept alive all across the United
States.
So, in memory of those who dared to follow their dreams, I respectfully dedi-
cate this great museum.
Thank you.
NOTE: The President spoke at 5:50 p.m. In his open-
ing remarks, he referred to George Bush, Chief of
the U.S. Liaison Office in the People's Republic of
China, and Russ Ramsland, president of the
museum.

Statement on the Death of Jack Bell.
September 15, 1975
I WAS saddened to learn of Jack Bell's death. A Washington political writer
and author for more than three decades, he was also one of the best reporters
I have ever known. Jack was a thorough, untiring newsman, always seeking
more detail, more substance, more facts. He knew as much about national
politics as many of us directly involved in it—and perhaps a bit more. He had
the great ability to put complex issues in concrete, easy-to-understand terms.
American journalism has lost one of its giants and American readers one of
their most respected bylines. Mrs. Ford joins me in sending our condolences to
Mrs. Bell and her family.
NOTE: Mr. Bell was a reporter for the Gannett News Service.
