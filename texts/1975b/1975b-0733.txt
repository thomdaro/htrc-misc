The President's News Conference of
October 10, 1975
STATEMENT ON GRAIN SALES TO POLAND AND THE UNION OF SOVIET SOCIALIST
REPUBLICS
Thank you very much, Mr. Barnes, members of the Detroit Press Club, and
guests:
[1.] A very short announcement at the outset:
As most of you know, the United States had requested last month that the
Government of Poland refrain from additional purchases of U.S. grain until
the October crop report. Because today's crop report contains, as we expected,
an excellent crop forecast, I have today authorized that Poland be notified that
it may now resume purchases. We anticipate that their purchases will be spread
out over a period of time. With respect to future grain sales to the Soviet Union,
both for this year's crop and for the long-term contract, negotiations are con-
tinuing, and we hope to conclude an agreement in the very near future.
Secretary Butz will be holding a briefing in Washington at 4:30 p.m., going
over the crop report and the Polish grain sale.
With that announcement, the first question from Mr. Clark Hallas [Detroit
News].
QUESTIONS
MICHIGAN GOVERNOR WILLIAM MILLIKEN
[2.] Q. Mr. President, have you urged Governor Milliken to run for the
Senate seat to be vacated by Senator Hart?
THE PRESIDENT. I have not urged Governor Milliken to run for the Senate
seat. Governor Milliken, I think, has to make that judgment or that decision
himself.
There are already some announced, or tentatively announced, candidates, and
it seems to me that that is a decision for the Governor to make. He knows the
situation better than I.
Q. Would you welcome his entry into the race?
