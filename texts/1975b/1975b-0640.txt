Remarks and a Question-and-Answer Session at the White House
Conference on Domestic and Economic Affairs in Omaha.
October 1, 1975

billion worth of various agricultural commodities. Without these exports, our
country would have had a huge balance-of-payments deficit, our dollar would
have been weakened abroad, and we would be paying far higher prices for all
the imports that we get from many, many countries.
