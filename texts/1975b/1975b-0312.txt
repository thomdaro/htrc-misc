Message on the Observance of Women's Equality Day, 1975.
August 26, 1975
THE CELEBRATION of Women's Equality Day reminds us of how much
more needs to be done to make equal opportunity a reality in our national life.
Last year the United States joined with nations around the world in proclaim-
ing 1975 as International Women's Year. This should add even greater encour-
agement to our national goals in this vitally important area.
Women's Equality Day gives me another welcome chance to assure all
Americans that their Government is firmly committed to achieving a record
during this important year which will be a source of national pride to us and
inspiration to others. We are determined to make our Government a showcase
of equal opportunity. Guided by the firm belief that our Nation derives its
vitality from this basic concept, we shall not waiver in our task to make it the
cornerstone of daily life throughout our country.

greatly missed. But his achievements-peaceful cooperation among African
