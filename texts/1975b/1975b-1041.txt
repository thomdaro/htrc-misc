Memorandum Extending the Federal Cost Reduction
Campaign. December 11, 1975
[Dated December 10, 1975. Released December 11, 1975]
Memorandum for the Heads of Departments and Agencies
On May 6 of this year, I announced a campaign for cost reduction within the
Federal Government. I am pleased and grateful that the response of civilian and
military personnel has been outstanding.
It has been my pleasure to sign 362 congratulatory letters for constructive ideas
and other contributions which produced savings to the Government of $25
million. These outstanding results demonstrate the interest and abilities of those
in the public service of our Nation.
The need is great to continue to reduce Federal spending and to conserve
energy and other vital resources. Because civilian and military personnel can
help meet this urgent need, I am extending the cost reduction campaign through
May 5, 1976. Therefore, I ask that until that date you continue to inform me of
contributions approved within the Federal Incentive Awards Program which
have measurable benefits of $5,000 or higher. Further, I urge that agencies con-
tinue to use this program to encourage and to recognize cost saving and other
significant achievements made by Federal personnel.

the Congress on a bipartisan basis for the rapid and, I think, constructive enact-
ment of this important legislation.
The repeal of the fair trade laws will permit consumers to get the discounts
in all 50 States. And the best way to ensure that consumers are paying the most
