Memorandum on Measures To Meet Natural Gas Shortages.
November 6, 1975
Memorandum for Members of the Energy Resources Council
Subject: Coordinating Near-Term Natural Gas Activities
Last May, the Federal Energy Administration was given responsibility for
leading an interagency effort to develop policy recommendations to deal with
projected natural gas shortages for this winter. In August, I approved recom-
mendations from the ERC, including proposed legislation and administrative
actions.
I have asked Frank Zarb, in his capacity as Executive Director of the Energy
Resources Council, to assume responsibility for coordinating efforts of the
agencies represented on the Energy Resources Council concerned with expected
natural gas shortages. I also have asked that the activities of ERC agencies be
conducted in close cooperation with those of the Federal Power Commission.
I trust each of you will extend to him and to the interagency task force he has
established full cooperation on this critical and urgent matter.

Exchange With Reporters on Departure From Westover Air Force
Base, Massachusetts. November 7, 1975
HOW ARE you all? It is nice to see you. I have a couple of minutes here if you
want to ask a question or two.
REPORTER. Mr. President, we have really got a State that is concerned about
jobs, about a 16-percent unemployment. Do you see any possibility of the Gov-
ernment as an employer of last resort, especially in the Northeast, which has
been pretty hard hit?
