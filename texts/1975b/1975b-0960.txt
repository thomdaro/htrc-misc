Special Message to the Congress Reporting on Budget
November 18, 1975
Rescissions and Deferrals.
To the Congress of the United States:
In accordance with the Impoundment Control Act of 1974, I herewith propose
six new rescissions totalling $1,289.1 million in budget authority. In addition, I
am reporting three new deferrals totalling $15.2 million in budget authority
and two supplementary reports to deferrals previously transmitted that increase
the amount deferred by $4 million.
The six proposed rescissions are for education programs of the Department of
Health, Education, and Welfare. The rescissions would reduce Federal spend-
ing for programs that are responsibilities of State and local jurisdictions, fail to
effectively focus on the persons in need of assistance, or are not justifiable on
programmatic grounds.
Approval of the rescissions will reduce spending by $182 million this year,
by $61 million in the transition quarter, by $839 million in 1977, and by $208
million in later years. I reiterate my firm belief that the American people want
to avoid excessive Federal spending. Agreement by the Congress with these
rescission proposals is an important step in avoiding unnecessary increases in
Federal expenditures.
The deferrals reported are all routine in nature. Two of the deferrals are for
programs of the Department of Health, Education, and Welfare. Another de-
ferral is for a program of the Department of State. Two more deferrals concern
