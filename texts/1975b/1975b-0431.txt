Gerald R. Ford, 1975
from Nebraska, from Mississippi-well, from all over the country-and isn't
that what we really want? We want Republicans in this building and in this
country from all 50 States.
So, thank you very much for being here.
NOTE: The President spoke at 7:44 p.m. at the club.
In his remarks, he referred to Harold R. Collier,
Representative from Illinois 1957-75 and president
of the club, Charles T. Marck, member of the club's
executive committee, and James C. Auchincloss,
Representative from New Jersey 1943-65.

Message to the Congress Transmitting Annual Report of the
National Advisory Council on Economic Opportunity.
September 11, 1975
To the Congress of the United States:
I herewith transmit the Eighth Annual Report of the National Advisory
Council on Economic Opportunity.
The report provides a perspective and recommendations which are, of course,
limited to the particular area of interest of the National Advisory Council on
Economic Opportunity. Thus, the report does not reflect the Administration's
policies which must be formed in the context of a comprehensive review of the
total Federal role and capability to assist the poor in light of other competing
priorities.
The White House,
September 11, 1975.
GERALD R. FORD
NOTE: The report is entitled "National Advisory Council on Economic Opportunity-Eighth Annual Re-
port" (Government Printing Office, 132 pp.).
