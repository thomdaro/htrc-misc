Public Papers of the Presidents
SECRETARY KISSINGER. Exactly, Mr. President. That is the problem, that the
continuation of the stalemate would have had both military and economic con-
sequences for the world that we had to do something about.
THE PRESIDENT. You are leaving very shortly, as I understand, for the actual
initialing.
SECRETARY KISSINGER. I am going to see Prime Minister Rabin now, and then
we are going to initial the documents.
THE PRESIDENT. Right.
SECRETARY KISSINGER. Then shortly after that, I will go to Egypt to meet with
President Sadat and participate in the initialing of the documents there.
THE PRESIDENT. You will actually carry the documents with you to Alex-
andria, then?
SECRETARY KISSINGER. Exactly, the documents and maps.
The President. I am going to call the Prime Minister after talking with you,
and I will express to him my appreciation, but if you will do it in person for
me, I would also be very grateful.
SECRETARY KISSINGER. I will do that, Mr. President, and I look forward very
much to seeing you on Thursday.
THE PRESIDENT. You are getting in Wednesday night, as I understand?
Secretary KissingER. That is right. I am getting in Wednesday night about
9 or 10 o'clock.
THE PRESIDENT. Well, I will be at the airport to meet you.
SECRETARY KISSINGER. Thank you very much.
The President. And it is arranged for us to have a [Congressional] bipartisan
leadership meeting on Thursday morning at 8 a.m.
SECRETARY KISSINGER. Good.
THE PRESIDENT. And I am sure that their reaction will be the same as mine,
that this is a great achievement for not only the parties involved but for the
world as a whole, and I just can't express deeply enough my appreciation for
your own magnificent efforts in this area.
SECRETARY KISSINGER. Mr. President, we have worked together on this, and
your strong support and your leadership and your talks with Sadat and Rabin
made this possible.
THE PRESIDENT. You go over there and participate with the Prime Minister,
give him my best, and at the same time give Nancy my very best.
SECRETARY KISSINGER. Thank you, and the best to Betty.
THE PRESIDENT. Thank you very much, and we will see you Wednesday
