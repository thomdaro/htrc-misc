The Report describes the activities of the National Institutes of Health (NIH),
the Health Services Administration (HSA), and the Center for Disease Control
(CDC). Research and development are underway at NIH in the diagnosis,
treatment, and prevention of Cooley's anemia. High priority is being given to
the development and evaluation of effective, nontoxic iron chelating agents to
reduce iron buildup which occurs in the bodies of patients treated for Cooley's
anemia with periodic blood transfusions.
High priority also is being given to pilot programs in screening, education,
and counseling in coordination with NIH and HSA. In addition, HSA is
evaluating the information gained from the extensive screening, treatment, and
counseling studies in sickle cell anemia (which is also a genetic blood disease)
as a means to plan more effectively the Cooley's anemia screening programs.
CDC is involved in a number of activities concerned with the laboratory de-
tection of Cooley's anemia, including screening techniques and educational
programs.

the first American-born saint of the Roman Catholic Church.
