A similar proposal will be signed by the Prime Minister of Israel. The text of
that document is also enclosed. I intend to request formally that Congress ap-
prove this document. I would appreciate your views on the form which this
approval should take. As soon as the official texts of the other documents related
to the Egypt-Israel agreement initialed on September 1st have been signed

the agreement and related documents for the information of the Congress.
