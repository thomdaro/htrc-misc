Memorandum on Appointing the Chairman of the
Interdepartmental Savings Bonds Committee. October 14, 1975
Memorandum for the Heads of Departments and Agencies
I have appointed Secretary of Commerce Rogers C. B. Morton as Chairman of
the Interdepartmental Savings Bonds Committee. He succeeds Secretary of
Agriculture Earl Butz, who has served in that capacity with great distinction
since 1972.
The Savings Bond Program offers a convenient way for every American to
build financial security.
The success of this vital program owes much to the broad acceptance by Fed-
eral employees of the Payroll Savings Plan. It is essential for each of us to provide
effective leadership by encouraging every employee to buy Savings Bonds
regularly.
Secretary Morton has my full support as he undertakes this new respon-
sibility. I know he can count on your fullest personal interest and cooperation in
attaining new high levels of participation in the Payroll Savings Plan throughout
the Federal establishment.

Statement on Receiving the Report of the Domestic Council
Drug Abuse Task Force. October 14, 1975
DURING the last 6 months the Domestic Council has conducted an intensive
review of the drug abuse problem in the United States. I directed this review
because I was concerned about reports of increasing availability and use of drugs.
Specifically, I wanted to know the extent and nature of drug abuse in this coun-
try and the effectiveness of our current programs in responding to this serious
problem.
The Domestic Council Drug Abuse Task Force has completed its review and
has prepared a "White Paper on Drug Abuse" for my consideration. I am grate-
ful to the Vice President, the members of the task force, and to the many others
from inside and outside of government who offered advice and counsel in the
preparation of this report.
