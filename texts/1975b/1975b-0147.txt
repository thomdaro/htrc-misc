But those principles, though they are still being perfected, remain the guid-
ing lights of an American policy. And the American people are still dedicated,

liberty, and the pursuit of happiness for all peoples everywhere.
To our fellow participants in this Conference: My presence here symbolizes
my country's vital interest in Europe's future. Our future is bound with yours.
Our economic well-being, as well as our security, is linked increasingly with
yours. The distance of geography is bridged by our common heritage and our
common destiny. The United States, therefore, intends to participate fully in the
affairs of Europe and in turning the results of this Conference into a living
reality.
To America's allies: We in the West must vigorously pursue the course upon

We will spare no effort to ease tensions and to solve problems between us. But
it is important that you recognize the deep devotion of the American people and
their Government to human rights and fundamental freedoms and thus to the
pledges that this Conference has made regarding the freer movement of people,
ideas, information.
In building a political relationship between East and West, we face many
challenges.

the past; it can provide an example of peaceful settlement in the future. The
United States regards it as a test of d√©tente and of the principles of this Confer-
ence. We welcome the fact that, subject to Four-Power rights and responsibili-
ties, the results of CSCE apply to Berlin as they do throughout Europe.
Military stability in Europe has kept the peace. While maintaining that
stability, it is now time to reduce substantially the high levels of military forces
on both sides. Negotiations now underway in Vienna on mutual and balanced
