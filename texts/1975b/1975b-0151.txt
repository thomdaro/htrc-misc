about a new agreement, one that is going to make it much more difficult to
police?
The President. The closing of the bases in Turkey by the Congressional

[4.] Q. Mr. President, you said earlier that you have to convince your peo-
ple, as the Russians have to convince their people, of the wisdom of the SALT
talks. Do you think that the American people need much convincing about
SALT?
The President. I am convinced the American people want their President,
their Government, to make responsible and safe agreements. On the other
