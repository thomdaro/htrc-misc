Gerald R. Ford, 1975
voted for it and very few Democrats did. That, in my opinion, was a rejection
of the ceiling concept at that time. But after the veto of the tax bill and it being
sustained, the Democrats in the Congress then came forward with this dollar-
for-dollar reduction in taxes and a dollar-for-dollar reduction in Federal spend-
ing. It was their proposition, but it followed the guidelines that was within
