Remarks for Thanksgiving Day.
November 26, 1975
[Recorded November 25, 1975. Released November 26, 1975]
AS AMERICANS celebrate Thanksgiving Day, we once more count our boun-
tiful blessings. We give thanks, first and foremost, to the Supreme Creator.
We are thankful that our Nation is at peace.
This holiday reminds us of our duty to provide responsibly for the needs of
our families and of our neighbors—the same values that guided those who
celebrated our first Thanksgiving.
We recognize anew our national motto which proclaims "In God We Trust.”
We continue to trust. Our faith has been vindicated as we approach a bicenten-
nial of national thanksgiving.
Our belief in America's goodness, in America's greatness, and in America's
future continues to inspire us.
In that spirit, my family and I gratefully give thanks and wish all of you a
very happy Thanksgiving Day.
NOTE: The President spoke at 1:55 p.m. in the Cabinet Room at the White House. His remarks were
recorded for later use on radio and television.
