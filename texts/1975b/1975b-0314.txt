Public Papers of the Presidents
My overriding objective is to achieve national economic stability for all
Americans. Full comparability pay, at this time, is inconsistent with my course
of action to build a strong and stable economy and to bring inflation under con-
trol. Therefore, the size of the proposed pay raise must be temporarily restrained
for the economic well-being of the Nation as a whole.
The pay act gives me the authority to propose whatever alternative pay adjust-
ment I consider appropriate in the light of “economic conditions affecting the
general welfare.” The pay increase I have chosen will allow the Federal Gov-
ernment to lead the fight against inflation by example, and not just words alone.
It is my considered judgment that the salary adjustment should level off at
the five percent increase which I called for last January. I strongly urge the
Congress to support the alternative recommendation which is attached.

Statement on the Death of Former President Eamon de Valera
of Ireland.
August 29, 1975
IT IS with profound regret that I have learned of the death of Eamon de Valera,
the former President of Ireland. I extend my deepest sympathy and that of the
American people to his family and to the people and the Government of
Ireland. For half a century, Mr. de Valera was a symbol of Ireland's ideals and
aspirations. He served the Irish people devotedly and unstintingly, as parlia-
mentarian, Prime Minister, and as President for 14 years. Mr. de Valera also
personified the ties of kinship and friendship between Ireland and the United
States. Together with the Irish people, we mourn his passing.
NOTE: Eamon de Valera was Prime Minister 1932-48, 1951-54, and 1957-59, and President 1959-73.
