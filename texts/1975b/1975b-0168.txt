Remarks on Arrival at Belgrade, Yugoslavia.
August 3, 1975
President Tito, ladies and gentlemen:
Mrs. Ford, our son Jack, and I have looked forward to this visit to Yugoslavia,
a country of great beauty and a country with fierce pride in its independence.
It is also a very great pleasure for me to make my first visit here as President
of the United States.
Twelve years ago I came to Yugoslavia as a Member of the Congress on a
far less happy occasion—Skopje had been devastated by an earthquake. I remem-
ber the sad and very grim scene. Mrs. Ford and I visited Skopje. I am very
pleased to learn that Skopje has been rebuilt into a beautiful and modern city.
This is representative of the progress made throughout Yugoslavia in recent
years. It is a fine example of what creativity, hard work, and determination—
well-known characteristics of the Yugoslav people—can achieve.
I am looking forward to my talks with you, Mr. President. You are truly
respected in America and throughout the world as one of the great men of the
postwar era. I am confident that our discussions of bilateral issues and questions
affecting the peace and security and welfare of the world will add to our mutual
understanding, to the friendly relations of our two countries, and the friend-
ship between Yugoslavs and Americans.
Mr. President, you and I have just returned from Helsinki where we attended
