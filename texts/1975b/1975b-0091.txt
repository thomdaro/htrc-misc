Message to the Congress Transmitting Annual Reports of
Six River Basin Commissions. July 24, 1975
To the Congress of the United States:
I am transmitting herewith the annual reports of the six river basin commis-
sions, as required under section 204 (2) of the Water Resources Planning Act of
1965.
The act states that commissions comprised of State and Federal members may
be established at the request of the Governors of the States within the proposed
commission area. Each commission is responsible for planning the best use of
water and related land resources in its area and for recommending priorities for
implementation of such planning. The commissions, through efforts to increase
public participation in the decisionmaking process, can and do provide a forum
for all people within the commission area to voice their ideas, concerns and
suggestions.
The commissions submitting reports are New England, Great Lakes, Pacific
Northwest, Ohio, Missouri, and Upper Mississippi. The territory these six com-
missions cover includes part or all of 32 States.
The enclosed annual reports indicate the activities and accomplishments of
the commissions during fiscal year 1974. A brief description of current and po-
tential problems, studies, and approaches to solutions is included in the reports.
The White House,
