Public Papers of the Presidents
any legislation you might get from Congress that would aim in that general
direction?
The President. I don't think any legislation that I have heard people com-
ment about or any legislation that I have read about would justify approval by
myself. The legislation that I have heard about is a long way from getting
through the Congress.
Every place I go, I check with Members of the Congress-Democratic or
Republicanâ€”and I check, as some of you may know, with people in various
communities. And I find no substantial sentiment for any legislation of one kind

you and others have said that the American people want this? How do you know
they want this?
THE PRESIDENT. I have been watching some of the polls taken nationally for
the last several months, and there is a general consensus that Federal spending
