Statement on United States Grain Sales to the Soviet Union.
September 9, 1975
THE PURCHASE by the Soviet Union of wheat and feed grains in the United
States has been highly erratic over the years. The following table shows these
purchases for recent years, including purchases to date for the 1975-76 season:

The considerable variation in large bulk purchases by a single state trading
company contrasts with the more steady purchases of these grains by such
customers as commercial enterprises in Japan and Western Europe. Because these
purchases are highly variable and uncertain, American farmers have not been
able to count on this market in their planting intentions to the extent they have
on other foreign purchasers. Moreover, highly volatile and unpredictable pur-
chases emerging after the crop planting tend to contribute to price instability.
It would contribute materially to the interests of the American farmer, workers
in the transportation industries, and American consumers, as well as be in the
interests of our customers abroad, if we could develop a longer-term and more
certain purchase understanding with the Soviet Union, providing among other
features for certain minimum purchases.
It will take some time to explore the possibilities of a long-term agreement.
The country must have a new procedure for the sale of feed grains and wheat to
such a large state purchaser as the Soviet Union. I am sending representatives to
the Soviet Union at once. I am also establishing a Food Committee of the
Economic Policy Board/National Security Council in my office to monitor these
developments.
We have already sold a volume of wheat and feed grains which will take 4 to 6
months to ship at maximum rates of transportation operations. Accordingly,
