to a black man who died leading a protest against the British 6 years before our
Declaration of Independence.
As early as 1770, your Baptist faith began to take a foothold in America. At
that time blacks were organizing Baptist state conventions in our various
colonies.
Through the years, religion has always been a very important force in
American life. It has been one of the pillars of black communities, as witness
to your faith in God and all that is right.
As we look back on some of the shortcomings of America, slavery leaves a

country needs now and in the future.
History has not recorded accurately the countless contributions made by
blacks to America. Yet times are changing as we begin our Bicentennial cele-

vitally important black contributions to our history.
The right to vote is the cornerstone of our democracy. I was proud to have
