Administration of Jimmy Carter, 1978
Vice President Mondale's Trip
to the Pacific Area
Statement by the President Announcing the
Trip. February 17, 1978
Since my schedule will not permit me
to travel to the Pacific area during 1978,
I have asked Vice President Mondale to
serve as my personal representative on a
trip to this region in mid-April.
The Vice President will visit New Zea-
land, Australia, Indonesia, Thailand, and
the Philippines, in that order. His mis-
sion underscores the importance my ad-
ministration attaches to this region of the
world where we retain vital security in-
terests and where we have very large and
rapidly growing commercial ties.
The Vice President will discuss our se-
curity and economic relations with our
ANZUS partners during his stops in Well-
ington and Canberra. His visits to Ja-
karta, Bangkok, and Manila will enable
us to strengthen our links with the na-
tions of ASEAN.
