discovery or invention designed to make
our lives a little better can, in the wrong
hands, become an instrument of tragedy
and suffering. Nothing better illustrates
this than the problem of drug abuse in
America. When used properly, today's
drugs can work miracles that were un-

they fall into the hands of the immature,
the careless, the ignorant, or the despair-

who is addicted to heroin, and the victim
of disease who grows dependent upon pre-

availability of drugs and seeking better
methods of treating the drug abuser are
