National Maritime Day, 1978
Proclamation 4555. March 16, 1978
By the President of the United States
of America
A Proclamation
The American Merchant Marine is the
lifeline that links America with its over-
seas trading partners. In times of peace, it
builds our economy; in times of national
emergency, it provides logistic support to
our armed forces.
In recognition of the importance of the
American Merchant Marine, the Con-
gress, by joint resolution of May 20, 1933
(48 Stat. 73; 36 U.S.C. 145), designated
May 22 of each year as National Mari-
time Day in commemoration of the de-
parture from Savannah, Georgia, on that
date in 1819 of the SS Savannah on the
first transatlantic voyage by any steam-
ship, and requested the President to issue
annually a proclamation calling for its
propriate observance.
ap-
Now, Therefore, I, JIMMY CARTER,
President of the United States of America,
do hereby urge the people of the United
States to honor our American Merchant
Marine on May 22, 1978, by displaying
the flag of the United States at their
homes and other suitable places, and I
request that all ships sailing under the
American flag dress ship on that day.
IN WITNESS WHEREOF, I have here-
unto set my hand this sixteenth day of
March, in the year of our Lord nineteen
hundred seventy-eight, and of the Inde-
pendence of the United States of America
the two hundred and second.

Aldo Moro
Letter to President Giovanni Leone of Italy
on the Kidnapping of the Former Italian
Prime Minister. March 16, 1978
Dear Mr. President:
I was shocked to hear of the terrorist
kidnapping of Aldo Moro. I know that
millions of Americans join me in praying
for his quick and safe return. This outrage
deeply affects all of us. Please convey my
personal sympathies to the Moro family
and to the families of the brave men slain
in the line of duty in this senseless terrorist
attack.
Sincerely,
JIMMY CARTER
NOTE: Former Prime Minister Moro was ab-
ducted in Rome en route from his home to a
meeting of the Italian Parliament by members
of the Red Brigades, an Italian terrorist group.
His bodyguards were slain during the incident.
