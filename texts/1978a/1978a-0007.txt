Foreword
The regular publication of Presidential papers is one of countless procedures—
large and small, public and private, mandated by law or fixed by custom—which,
taken together, make the United States an open society. This volume, covering
the first half of 1978, is as much a dialog with the present as it is a record for the
future.
These papers reflect the variety of a President's roles, from ceremonial leader
to party chieftain, from partner with Congress in the making of laws to repre-
sentative of the Nation in the building of a more peaceful world. They reflect
as well the vast scope and complexity of the public concerns of Americans in a
challenging time.
During the first half of 1978, efforts launched in my administration's
initial year began to bear fruit. Important gains were made in such areas as
employment and farm income. The Panama Canal treaties, ratified during this
period, opened a new era of cooperation in our hemisphere.
Some of the speeches and documents collected here were painstakingly
prepared; others were extemporaneous. All, I hope, show my concern with
bringing government closer to the people, with responding to human needs, with
protecting our liberties and our national values, with preserving natural resources,
with strengthening our economy-and, most of all, with building a world of
stability, security, and peace.
Jimmy Carter
