White House Statement. May 26, 1978
President Carter hosted a dinner this
evening for President Giscard d'Estaing,
the Minister of Foreign Affairs, and high
officials accompanying him. This was the
French President's first visit to the White
House in the Carter administration. The
two Presidents last met in Paris in
January.
During this informal dinner, President
Giscard d'Estaing outlined the proposals
he made this week at the U.N. Special
Session on Disarmament. The two Presi-
dents also discussed a wide range of inter-
national issues affecting their two coun-
tries, including East-West relations, the
forthcoming seven-nation summit in Bonn
this July, and the Middle East. They ex-
pressed their common concern about re-
cent developments in Africa and agreed
that concerted action with the African
countries is necessary to promote security
and development in that continent.
Both Presidents welcomed this chance
to renew their friendship. The talks were
conducted in an atmosphere of personal
warmth and mutual understanding. They
also reaffirmed the close ties between
France and the United States, which this
year are celebrating the 200th anniversary
of their alliance.
