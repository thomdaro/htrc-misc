Remarks at a White House Reception.
April 5, 1978
First of all, let me say that I feel like
I'm among friends and among partners.
I've had this feeling ever since I have
been
been involved in politics. And I had it
strengthened in 1975, when I was with
you in San Diego at your convention. A
lot of you were there. It was when I was
lonely and searching for friends. And I
reached out my hand and you took it, and
you helped me in Florida and all the suc-
ceeding primaries. I won't forget Texas.
You helped me during the general elec-
tion, and I particularly thank you, since I
have been President and living in this
house, that you've helped me even more
as the leader of our country.
On behalf of myself and Rosalynn, our
entire family, I want you to know that
you're welcome, you're part of our family,
and you belong here as much as we do.
Thank you for coming this afternoon.
We also share something else. You were
born in October; so was I. You were born
we're not exactly the same on everything.
40 years ago. Well-[laughter]â€”well,
But I know that this last year, because you
are a part of our Nation which is enlight-
ened and progressive and concerned
about the essence of our country, you
represent democratic principles in all
their finest aspects. You are respected and
trusted throughout the country in your
own local communities as an organiza-
tion, on Capitol Hill, and throughout
places where decisions are made.
This is a great tribute to you. Last year,
when I came into office in January, we
had almost a 9 percent, over 8 percent
unemployment rate. We had a 9, 10 per-
cent inflation rate. With your help and
with the help of the fine Democratic Con-
gress on the Hill, we were able to put into
law some very effective programs that
were able to cut down unemployment
much more than we had anticipated. We
created a net of 4.1 million new jobs in
the United States. It was a great achieve-
ment. You helped me with it. And I
would not have been able to get this bill
