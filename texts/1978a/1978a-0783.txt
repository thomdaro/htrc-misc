Administration of Jimmy Carter, 1978
of a truly national market for natural
gas,
as well as a crucial breakthrough toward
enactment of the Nation's first and long-
delayed national energy plan.
This agreement could not have been
reached without the tireless efforts of
both Democrats and Republicans work-
ing in the national interest to overcome
the years of conflict and strongly held
positions that have characterized this
issue.
A solution to the natural gas issue has
eluded Presidents and Congresses for over
a quarter of a century. If, as I hope, this
agreement is approved by the conference,
it will be the first conference report on
natural gas in 22 years.
I am particularly pleased that this hard-
fought compromise, according to best
available estimates, will cost American
consumers no more than they would pay
if today's inadequate regulatory system
were to be retained. If this compromise is
accepted by the Congress, new supplies of
natural gas formerly available only in the
intrastate market will flow to the gas-
starved interstate system at reasonable
prices. These new supplies will replace
far more expensive alternative fuels, in-
cluding imported oil.
I want to give special recognition to
conference chairman Harley Staggers of
West Virginia, and energy committee
chairman Henry Jackson of Washington,
as well as energy committee chairmen
John Dingell of Michigan and Lud Ashley
of Ohio.
In addition, this accord could not have
been achieved without the special efforts
of Senators Dale Bumpers of Arkansas,
Pete Domenici of New Mexico, Jim Mc-
Clure of Idaho, Mark Hatfield of Oregon,
Bennett Johnston of Louisiana, and
Wendell Ford of Kentucky, and Congress-
men Bob Eckhardt of Texas, Paul Rogers
of Florida, Philip Sharp of Indiana, and
Charles Wilson of Texas.
