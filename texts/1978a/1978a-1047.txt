Administration of Jimmy Carter, 1978
June 2
pursuant to subsection 405 (b) (1) of the
Act, that a satisfactory balance of con-
cessions in trade and services has been
maintained during the life of the Agree-
ment on Trade Relations between the
United States of America and the So-
cialist Republic of Romania. I further
determine that actual or foreseeable re-
ductions in United States tariffs and non-
tariff barriers to trade resulting from mul-
tilateral negotiations are satisfactorily
reciprocated by the Socialist Republic of
Romania.
This finding and determination shall
be published in the FEDERAL REGISTER.

Presidential Determination No. 78-14
Memorandum for the Secretary of State
Subject: Determination under Subsec-
tions 402(d) (5) and (d) (5) (C) of the
Trade Act of 1974-Continuation of
Waiver Authority
Pursuant to the authority vested in me
under the Trade Act of 1974, (Public
Law 93-618, January 3, 1975; 88 Stat.
1978) (hereinafter "the Act"), I deter-
mine, pursuant to Subsections 402 (d) (5)
and (d) (5) (C) of the Act, that the fur-
ther extension of the waiver authority
granted by Subsection 402 (c) of the Act
will substantially promote the objectives
of Section 402 of the Act. I further deter-
mine that continuation of the waivers ap-
plicable to the Socialist Republic of Ro-
mania and to the Hungarian People's Re-
public will substantially promote the
objectives of Section 402 of the Act.
This determination shall be published
