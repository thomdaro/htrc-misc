THE PRESIDENT. Frances, congratula-
tions.
Ms. BLUM. Joanne Nicoletti.
THE PRESIDENT. Joanne, good luck,
and thank you for the good work.
Ms. BLUM. Joseph Sabik.
THE PRESIDENT. Joseph, good to see
you.
Ms. BLUM. Janet Vincelette (Ms.
Blum should have said "Ann Salois.")
THE PRESIDENT. Thank you very
much. Is that the wrong name?
Ms. BLUM. Stephen Vincelette.
THE PRESIDENT. Is that right? Okay.
Ms. BLUM. Janice Yee.
THE PRESIDENT. Janice, congratula-
tions to you.
Well, I want to say in closing that this
is a group who have been chosen to rep-
resent the 70,000 other young people of
their age who have participated in these
practical explorations of streams, yards,
and schoolgrounds, noise levels, garbage
dumps, waste disposal, air pollution,
every aspect of environmental quality.
And what they do can make Doug
Costle's job much easier in the future by
cutting down on the violations of the law
and the violations of the purity of the air
and water and earth that God gave us in
our beautiful country.
Congratulations to you, Doug, on es-
tablishing the program and seeing it
grow. I hope it'll be an even greater suc-
cess, Barbara, this coming year.
Ms. BLUM. Thank you.
THE PRESIDENT. Thank you, every-
body. We are deeply indebted to you for
setting an example for the rest of the
country, and I'm proud of
you.
NOTE: The President spoke at 12 noon at the
ceremony in the Cabinet Room at the White
House. Also participating in the ceremony
were Douglas M. Costle, Administrator, and
Barbara Blum, Deputy Administrator, Envi-
ronmental Protection Agency.

Consumer Affairs
Memorandum From the President.
April 27, 1978
Memorandum for the Heads of Depart-
ments and Agencies
Because decisions made by government
have a direct and substantial impact on
the American consumer, I have a firm
commitment to consumer involvement in
government. One of this Administration's
principal goals is to ensure that each
agency of the Federal Government ade-
quately responds to consumer needs in its
development of policy and provides ade-
quate opportunities for consumer partici-
pation in its decisionmaking processes.
Therefore, I am immediately strength-
ening
of
ening the White House Office
Consumer Affairs and increasing its
responsibilities. I am asking my Special
Assistant for Consumer Affairs, Esther
Peterson, to fulfill the following re-
sponsibilities:
• To participate in the development of
domestic policy decisions and to ad-
vise me concerning the potential im-
pact on consumers of proposed or
existing policies and programs, and
pending legislation so that I may
have the benefit of the consumer
point of view when making decisions.
• To survey the consumer programs of
the various Federal agencies in order
to determine if there is a meaningful
consumer presence in each agency
and to make recommendations to me
on how my Administration might
further assure consumer involvement
in agency decisionmaking.
• To undertake a complete review of
Federal agency consumer programs
and to advise me as to whether these
programs are responsive to the needs
of consumers consistent with the con-
sumer policies and goals of my Ad-
