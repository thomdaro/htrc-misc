Administration of Jimmy Carter, 1978
Mar. 24
understanding can be achieved only if we
are willing to put aside our differences
and join together to solve our problems
and share our opportunities. Drawing
upon a common heritage and shared
hopes for the future, the nations of the
Americas constantly seek ways to
strengthen their ties with each other.
Their success in achieving these goals is
due in large measure to the Organization
of American States, the world's oldest
regional organization.
Through the Organization of American
States we in the Western Hemisphere
have developed a unique system of coop-
eration which promotes political under-
standing, economic progress and social
justice. An organization of great vitality
and adaptability, it is now responding
vigorously to the new challenges of the
last quarter of the twentieth century. For
these reasons, the United States continues,
and will continue, to lend its full support
to the Organization of American States
and the Inter-American System. Accord-
ingly, it is appropriate that we join with
its other members in reaffirming our
mutual commitment to friendship, trust
and cooperation.
Now, THEREFORE, I, JIMMY CARTER,
President of the United States of Amer-
ica, do hereby proclaim Friday, April 14,
1978, as Pan American Day, and the week
beginning April 9, 1978 as Pan American
Week and call upon all Americans to
honor these observances with ceremonies
and activities that will reflect the continu-
ing commitment of the United States of
America to a peaceful and productive re-
lationship among the nations and peoples
of the Western Hemisphere.
IN WITNESS WHEREOF, I have here-
unto set my hand this twenty-third day of
March, in the year of our Lord nineteen
hundred seventy-eight, and of the Inde-
pendence of the United States of America
the two hundred and second.
JIMMY CARTER
