goals both countries share for the con-

support for the principles of the Charter
of the United Nations and of the Orga-

of states, non-use of force in international
relations and for other principles of inter-

states. They agreed on the need to per-
severe in efforts to maintain international
peace, strengthen world security, inten-

Nations.
In the context of this global review, the
two Presidents noted the importance of
the United Nations and other interna-

putes, and agreed that their two Govern-
ments should maintain and expand their
cooperation in support of these mecha-
nisms and their increased effectiveness.
They also agreed to expand the annual
consultations between their two Govern-
ments preceding the UN General Assem-
bly sessions, and to bring within the pur-
view of these consultations negotiations
and meetings under UN auspices such as
the Law of the Sea Conference and the
United Nations Conferences on Tech-
nology and Development and Tech-
nical Cooperation among Developing
Countries.
The Presidents exchanged views con-
cerning the situation in the Middle East
and deplored the recent violence which
occurred in that area. They agreed that
it is necessary and urgent to intensify ef-
forts to achieve a just, comprehensive and
durable peace based on UNSC Resolu-
tion 242 and 338. They stressed the im-
portance of withdrawal on all fronts pur-
suant to Resolution 242 and the resolu-
tion of all aspects of the Palestinian
question.
The two Presidents emphasized their
concern with the arms race and re-
affirmed that they strongly favor the
adoption of disarmament measures under
strict and effective international control.
