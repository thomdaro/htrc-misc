3. Accordingly, the purpose of this
proclamation is to terminate in part Proc-
lamation No. 4445 of June 11, 1976, as
modified by Proclamation No. 4477 of
November 16, 1976, and Proclamation
No. 4509 of June 15, 1977, so as to ex-
clude so-called chipper knife steel and
band saw steel provided for in item
923.26, TSUS, from the present quantita-
tive restrictions for the remainder of the
restraint period which began on June 14,
1977 and the entire restraint period be-
ginning on June 14, 1978, and to make
an appropriate reduction in the quota
quantities for item 923.26, TSUS, appli-
cable to the European Economic Com-
munity and Sweden for the restraint pe-
riod beginning June 14, 1978 to reflect
the exclusion of so-called chipper knife
steel and band saw steel. The authority
for this action is set forth in section 203
(h) (4) (19 U.S.C. 2253 (h) (4)), and
