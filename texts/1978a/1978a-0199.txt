Budget Message
Message to the Congress Transmitting the
Fiscal Year 1979 Budget. January 20, 1978
To the Congress of the United States:
The first complete budget of any new
administration is its most important. It is
the administration's first full statement of
its priorities, policies, and proposals for
meeting our national needs. Last Feb-
ruary, after just one month in office, I
submitted a revised budget to the Con-
gress. That revision changed the direction
of the prior administration's budget, but
was of necessity-based upon a review
of limited scope. I promised then that
future budgets would reflect detailed,
zero-based reviews of Federal spending
programs, reform of the tax system, and
reorganization of the Government. This
budget is my first major step in meeting
that promise. It reflects, I believe, a deter-
mination to face and make difficult deci-
sions in a manner that places the common
good above that of any particular interest.
This budget represents a careful balanc-
ing of several considerations:
-The importance of a fiscal policy that
provides for a continuing recovery of
the Nation's economy from the
1974-75 recession;
-The obligation of the Government to
meet the critical needs of the Nation
and its people;
-The fact that resources are limited
and that Government must disci-
pline its choices and its scope; and
-The need for careful and prudent
management of the taxpayers' re-
sources.

My budget provides for total outlays
of $500 billion, an increase of $38 billion,
or 8%, over the 1978 budget, and receipts
of $440 billion. This budget total is a re-
strained one that:
-Meets essential national needs;
-Imposes strict priorities upon Fed-
eral expenditures; and
-Decreases the share of the Nation's
gross national product taken by the
Federal Government from 22.6% to
22.0%.

This budget places us on a path that will
permit a balanced budget in the future
if the private economy continues its re-
covery over the coming years.
At the same time, my budget embodies
a fiscal policy that will strengthen the
economic recovery. I propose a progres-
sive tax reduction of $25 billion to help
assure continued economic recovery and
reduction in unemployment. An integral
part of this tax reduction proposal is a set
of recommendations for tax reform that
