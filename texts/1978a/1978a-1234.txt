June 30
Administration of Jimmy Carter, 1978
never permit our Nation to be weak mili-
tarily, which guarantees us that we can
be strong in every other aspect of life.
So, to summarize my comments, I
would like to say that I'm proud to be
with these leaders whom we recognize. I
think I know our country well. Our peo-
ple are committed to the principles that
I've outlined briefly this afternoon. We
want peace. We are determined to main-
tain peace. But we recognize that peace
can only come through strength. And that
we will also maintain in the United
States of America.
Thank you very much.
