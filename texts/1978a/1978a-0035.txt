Americans came to the Normandy beaches
and to the Marne to join France in pre-

The statue in the harbor of New York
that symbolizes our own liberty, like many
of the ideas which first inspired our own
demands for freedom, came as a gift from
the people of France.
Our approaches to specific questions
may not always be the same, but our deep
respect for the independence and leader-

each in turn, carried forward to the world
two centuries ago, and these are the values
which the world still depends upon us to
