May 5
Administration of Jimmy Carter, 1978
reminded of the wisdom and judgment
and common sense and the natural friend-
ship toward one another that exists
among the American people.
It's been a great occasion for me. I
thank you from the bottom of my heart.
NOTE: The President spoke at 1:30 p.m. at
the Spokane Convention Center.
Commemoration of the Victory
at Puebla, Mexico
Statement by the President. May 5, 1978
Today, the fifth of May, is an impor-
tant holiday for persons of Mexican an-
cestry.
This commemorates the victory at Pue-
bla, Mexico, in 1862 against the French
and symbolizes the freedom of people of
Mexican heritage from the yoke of
colonialism.
Mexican traditions in America pre-
date the landing of the Pilgrims at Plym-
outh Rock. Over the years, these tradi-
tions have deeply influenced the life of
this country and manifest themselves in
the architecture, music, literature, lan-
guage, family, and customs of America.
On this day of remembrance and cele-
bration, I ask all Americans to join me in
extending to our fellow citizens of Mex-
ican heritage warmest greetings for a
joyous and festive cinco de mayo!
