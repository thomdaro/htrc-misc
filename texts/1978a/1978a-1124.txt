Administration of Jimmy Carter, 1978
I understand that the committee will
consider further amendments tonight.
We are following continuing develop-
ments closely, and I would hope that the
committee would not add conditions of
a sort that would be inconsistent with our
objective of a workable and responsible
financing plan.
