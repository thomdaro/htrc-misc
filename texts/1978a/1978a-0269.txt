National Defense Transportation
Day and National Transportation
Week, 1978
Proclamation 4548. January 31, 1978
By the President of the United States
of America
A Proclamation
The United States is a nation depend-
ent on mobility. Transportation helps
maintain our prosperity, ensure our na-
tional defense, and bind us together as a
people. An efficient transportation net-
work is important to maintain our quality
of life and help our Nation conserve
precious petroleum.
Recognizing the fundamental relation-
ship between transportation and our Na-
tion's welfare, the Congress has requested
the President to proclaim annually the
third Friday in May as National Defense
Transportation Day and the week in
which that day falls as National Trans-
portation Week (71 Stat. 30, 36 U.S.C.
160; 76 Stat. 69, 36 U.S.C. 166).
Now, THEREFORE, I, JIMMY CARTER,
President of the United States of America,
do hereby designate Friday, May 19, 1978,
as National Defense Transportation Day,
and the week beginning May 14, 1978, as
National Transportation Week.
I urge the Governors of our States and
other appropriate officials, organizations
concerned with transportation, and the
people of the United States to join with
the Department of Transportation in ob-
serving this day and week.
IN WITNESS WHEREOF, I have here-
unto set my hand this thirty-first day of
January, in the year of our Lord nineteen
hundred seventy-eight, and of the Inde-
pendence of the United States of America
the two hundred and second.
