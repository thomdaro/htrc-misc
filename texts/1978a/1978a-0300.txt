attaché in Tunis.
From 1962 to 1964, Condon was re-

Michigan primary-[laughter]—and I
should have known what to expect.
I really tried to think of some criticism
or some funny things to say about Tip
O'Neill. But his being the Speaker and
such a close friend of mine, and our hav-
ing such an intimate political relation-
ship and my revering him so much, it was
impossible for me to think about anything
except [laughter]—serious matters.
When I first was elected and was pre-
paring for the transition phase between
November and January, I set up
what we
called the Talent Inventory Program, the
TIP program. And in January, when I
was packing to come to Washington, I
discovered that the Speaker's name was
Tip O'Neill. [Laughter]
I found also that we had a lot in com-
mon. We both have an Irish background.
His family was in the potato business in
Ireland, and my folks came about 50
years before him as a result of the great
peanut famine. [Laughter]
But in honor of Tip, we decided to let
our Talent Inventory Program pick out
the first two people from Massachusetts.
One was Evan Dobelle, who became the
protocol officer; the other one was Elliot
