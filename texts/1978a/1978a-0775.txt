Proclamation 4564. April 19, 1978
By the President of the United States
of America
A Proclamation
When the month of May was first set
aside in 1963 in special tribute to our
Nation's senior citizens, there were fewer
than eighteen million Americans over the
age of sixty-five. Today, their number ex-
ceeds twenty-three million.
Older Americans are an invaluable
source of talent, skills and experience.
Their sacrifice and hard work in the past
have brought us through wars and hard
times, and kept our Nation faithful to the
values and principles on which it was
founded. They are our link with what has
gone before, remembering the good things
we are in constant danger of losing, as well
as the bad things we have overcome, and
how it was possible. They can help us un-
derstand the mistakes of the past so that
we do not repeat them. They can help us
gather strength and courage from the wis-
dom of the past to make a better future
for our children.
Their skills and knowledge are impor-
tant to our economy, and it is important
to their lives and health that they be able
to remain as self-reliant as possible,
through employment and other opportu-
nities, and through necessary supportive
services that enable them to live their
later years in dignity and self-respect. Just
as they must not be arbitrarily excluded
from contributing to our society, they
