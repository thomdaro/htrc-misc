Apr. 19
Administration of Jimmy Carter, 1978
must not be asked to bear the burdens of
society when they are no longer able.
These men and women are a vital part
of this Nation. Like all Americans, they
need comfortable and safe places to live,
nutritious daily diets and adequate in-
comes and services to give them freedom
to make choices. We all must work to-
gether to create these conditions in our
communities.
Now, THEREFORE, I, JIMMY CARTER,
President of the United States of America,
do hereby designate the month of May as
Older Americans Month and I ask public
officials at all levels, community agencies,
educators, the clergy, the communica-
tions media and each American to help
make it possible for older Americans to
enjoy their later years.
IN WITNESS WHEREOF, I have here-
unto set my hand this nineteenth day of
April, in the year of our Lord nineteen
hundred seventy-eight, and of the Inde-
pendence of the United States of America
the two hundred and second.
JIMMY CARTER

Airline Deregulation Legislation.
Statement by the President. April 19, 1978
I welcome the Senate's action tonight
in passing, 83-9, the airline regulatory re-
form legislation.
This is an important step in the fight
against inflation, as I said in my anti-
inflation message last week. Many airline
carriers have already begun to reduce
fares in expectation of its enactment.
Making this bill law will guarantee that
the trend toward lower fares continues
and broadens to benefit more passen-
gers-and it will put an end to a form of
Government regulation of business that
is not only unnecessary but also counter-
productive from the public's point of
view.
Many Senators-and Senators Cannon,
Kennedy, and Pearson, in particularâ€”
deserve credit for their leadership on this
bill. I urge the House to act upon it soon
as well.
NOTE: The statement was released on April 20.
