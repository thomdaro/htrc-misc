June 20
Administration of Jimmy Carter, 1978
600 additional employees, at an annual
cost of $46.7 million, just to maintain ex-
isting fire protection. These additional
personnel and payroll measures are un-
acceptable.
I am very proud of the superb record
of Federal firefighters at our military in-
stallations. I know them to be hard-work-
ing and dedicated. The evidence is not
compelling, however, that they are unfair-
ly treated in matters of pay and length of
work week. And in extending unwar-
ranted advantages to them, H.R. 3161 of-
fends the ideals of fairness that should
guide this Administration. I am not pre-
pared to accept its preferential approach.
JIMMY CARTER
The White House,
June 19, 1978.

The House of Representatives reconsidered
H.R. 3161 on June 28, and the bill was re-
ferred to committee.
