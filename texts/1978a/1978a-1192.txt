William M. Ketchum
Statement on the Death of the Representative
From California. June 26, 1978
With the death of Congressman
William Ketchum of California, the Na-
tion has lost a fine public servant who
ably served his district in Congress.
Since he was first elected to the Con-
gress in 1972, Representative Ketchum
led the important fight for responsible
public spending and a balanced Federal
budget. His efforts on behalf of the elderly
earned the respect not only of the voters
of his district but of senior citizens across
the Nation.
I extend my own deepest sympathies
to his family.

stantial tax relief for almost every tax-
payer in our country. I also asked that
some important and long-overdue re-
forms be made in our unfair and very
complicated tax laws.
Last week it became clear that the Con-
gress is seriously considering a tax bill
that contains no major reforms at all.
That's bad enough, but this new con-
gressional proposal is even worse. It actu-
ally attempts to take a step backward
through some version of the so-called
Steiger capital gains amendment. This
proposal would add more than $2 billion
to the Federal budget deficit. Eighty per-
cent of its tax benefits would go to one-
