Administration of Jimmy Carter, 1978
Jan. 7
HAMILTON JORDAN
Q. Mr. President, I know Jody said
this is the last question, but I think all of
us here would be remiss because of the
rumors that have been going around, and
I will ask this while Ham is standing in
the door: There have been many rumors
since Ham came to Riyadh that some-
thing is going on, that he is leaving, that
he is not, that he is going to be chief of
staff. You could hear everything in the
world on this trip. I think it would do
yourself and Ham and us a service if we
could get some kind of statement from
you about if anything is going on.
THE PRESIDENT. No, nothing is going
on so far as I know. I don't want to
corroborate what Jody said. [Laughter]
Ham is the person in the White House
that analyzes for me and with me the
domestic, political considerations of both
domestic and foreign policy. And the
meeting with Sadat, when I didn't have
a chance to go to see Begin-because he
had just been to the United States and
because Cy Vance is going to Jerusalem
in 10 days—was kind of a sensitive po-
litical issue.
And I particularly wanted him to be
there with us to make sure that there was
an objectivity and a fairness between our
unscheduled visit with Sadat and our re-
sponsibility to the Israelis to be fair as a
mediator.
And that's why I wanted Ham to come
over. But there is no change. Hamilton
has no better relationship with me than
he had before. [Laughter]
REPORTER. Thank you, sir.
The President. I enjoyed it. Thank
you.
NOTE: The question-and-answer session was
