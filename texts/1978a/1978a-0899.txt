Aldo Moro
Statement on the Death of the Former Italian
Prime Minister. May 9, 1978
My sympathies and the sympathies of
all Americans go out to Aldo Moro's
bereaved family and nation.
His murder is a contemptible and cow-
ardly act. His death advances no cause
but that of mindless anarchy. But his life
was devoted to building his nation, and
his political skills were forever at the serv-
ice of justice.
He stood for civilization and the rule
of law, principles which will always out-
live the terrorism that seeks to destroy
them.
NOTE: Mr. Moro's body was recovered in cen-
tral Rome following his murder by members
of the Red Brigades, an Italian terrorist or-
ganization. The terrorists had abducted him
on March 16.
The White House announced that the Presi-
dent sent personal messages of condolence to
Mrs. Moro, President Giovanni Leone of Italy,
and Prime Minister Giulio Andreotti.
