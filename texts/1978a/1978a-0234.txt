Highway and Transit Programs
Message to the Congress Proposing
Legislation. January 26, 1978
To the Congress of the United States:
I am today transmitting to Congress
proposed legislation that will significantly
improve the organization and operation
of the Federal government's highway and
transit programs.
One of the Administration's important
goals is to develop a well balanced na-
tional transportation policy, one which
takes account of our increased sensitivity
to the effects of transportation on the
social and economic life of our cities and
rural communities. The reforms which
are proposed in this legislation are de-
signed to make certain that the nation has
an effective transportation system, which
uses energy more efficiently, enhances the
quality of life in our urban and rural
areas, and helps expand our economy.
The program I am proposing will in-
tensify the Federal effort to complete the
Interstate System and provide flexible
assistance for highway construction and
transit development. The legislation
would authorize more than $50 billion
over the next five years and proposes the
following changes to meet national trans-
portation needs:
â€”a comprehensive transportation plan-
ning program;
-measures to speed completion of the
Interstate System and to improve
maintenance;
