Administration of Jimmy Carter, 1978
New York City
United States Ambassador
Statement Following a Meeting With Mayor to Greece
Edward I. Koch. February 2, 1978
I was pleased to meet with Mayor Koch
today to discuss New York City's current
fiscal condition and its recently developed
budget and financing plans to cover the
next 4 years.
Mayor Koch is an able and courageous
man whose administration shows great
promise in its early days. He has a series
of difficult decisions to make. We both
share a commitment, which I believe re-
flects the expectation of the Congress, that
he will make those decisions in a way that
will restore New York to a sound financial
footing.
I assured him of my commitment to
preserve New York City's solvency. This
administration recognizes that New York
is the nerve center of some of the most
important activities in this country, and
I reiterate that bankruptcy is not an ac-
ceptable solution to its problems.
I reminded Mayor Koch that my com-
mitment to find a financial solution for the
Nomination of Robert J. McCloskey.
February 3, 1978
The President today announced that he
will nominate Robert J. McCloskey of
Chevy Chase, Md., to be Ambassador Ex-
traordinary and Plenitpotentiary of the
United States to Greece. He would re-
place Jack B. Kubisch, resigned.
McCloskey was born November 25,
1922, in Philadelphia, Pa. He received a
B.S. from Temple University in 1953. He
served in the U.S. Marine Corps from
1942 to 1945.
McCloskey was a public information
specialist at the State Department from
1958 to 1964, and director of the Office of
News from 1964 to 1966. From 1966 to
1969, he was Deputy Assistant Secretary
for the Bureau of Public Affairs.
From 1969 to 1973, McCloskey was
Deputy Assistant Secretary of State for
Press Relations and Special Assistant to
the Secretary of State. He was Ambas-
sador to Cyprus in 1973 and 1974. In
1975 and 1976, he was Ambassador at
Large and Assistant Secretary of State for
Congressional Relations. Since 1976 he
has been Ambassador to the Netherlands.
city has always presumed a maximum ef-
fort by all the local parties with an interest
in the city's future-the State, the finan-
cial community, the city and State pension
funds, the labor unions. I am certain that
the Congress would not approve a Federal Department of Energy
financing role, or other assistance, on any
other basis.
For these reasons, I have asked Secre-
tary Blumenthal to discuss with all of these
parties what they can do. Once I am satis-
fied that they all will do their part, I will
work hard to persuade the Congress to
enact a bill that will end the financial un-
certainty in New York.
