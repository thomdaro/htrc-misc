Anniversary of the Birth of
Martin Luther King, Jr.
Letter to Coretta Scott King.
December 28, 1977
To Coretta Scott King
Not yet half a century has passed since
your husband's birth, and he has already
been gone from us for almost a decade.
This anniversary reminds us forcefully of
what one life can mean and of what can
be done in a relatively short time to re-
move the obstacles that have blocked the
progress of human beings for generations.
Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr., left us
guideposts: his dedication to breaking
down the barriers that separated people
and his vision of a world where a person's
only limitations would be the individual's
own will and ability to learn and use
opportunities.
The non-violence he practiced requires
a spiritual, intellectual and even physical
commitmentâ€”a willingness to risk every-
thing on the principle that you can love
your enemies into submission to a higher
good. He became the worldwide symbol
of the power of that principle and the cost
of that commitment.
We must renew our own commitment,
must again tap that great power and use
it to solve the problems that still face those
he always championed, the poor and the
oppressed. He taught us that whatever
stands in the way of meeting needs can be
overcome even the inertia of the com-
fortable.
I join you in honoring him and the
cause of brotherhood he served.
Sincerely,
JIMMY CARTER
[Mrs. Coretta Scott King, The Martin Luther
King, Jr. Center for Social Change, 671 Beck-
with Street, S.W., Atlanta, Georgia 30314]

Dear Chairman Burns:
It is with sincere regret and a deep
