need to assist governments which find
themselves in financial crisis, if and when
they are willing to make sound measures
of self-help.
We need to support regional and sub-
regional cooperation and integration
through such organizations as the Carib-
bean Group for Cooperation in Economic
Development, which is meeting this week
in Washington-I think 30 countries.

Thank you very much.
NOTE: The President spoke at 11:24 a.m. in
the Hall of the Americas at the Pan American
Union Building.
The provisional Chairman and President of
the session was Indalecio Li√©vano Aguirre,
Foreign Minister of Colombia. Alejandro Orfila
is Secretary General of the Organization of
American States.
The recent decision by several Andean
countries to establish a balance-of-pay-

bution to regional financial stability. The
little-noticed increase in intraregional

integration of Latin America.
Finally, let me say this: We set for
ourselves an ambitious program last year.
Much has been accomplished, but much
more remains to be done.
The Organization of American States
can play an important role in addressing
and solving our common problems. It's
become particularly effective in the areas
of human rights and the keeping of the
peace. It can and must become still more
effective as its internal administrative and

greater equality in our relationships.

lations in this hemisphere and the world.
With trust and cooperation, even the
most difficult and serious disputes can be
settled.
The other nations in this hemisphere,
all of you, are increasingly important to
my country and to the world. I do not

Message to the Congress. June 21, 1978
To the Congress of the United States:
In recent years, the Congress has
strengthened its oversight of Executive
Branch decisions. I welcome that effort.
Unfortunately, there has been increasing
use of one oversight device that can do
more harm than good-the "legislative

simpler and divert attention from our
common task of improving Federal pro-

Since taking office, I have several times
expressed my deep reservations about
