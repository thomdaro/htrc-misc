When their crops fail, they need more
than the minimum tonnage committed
to help them meet their basic food re-
quirements."
The Food Aid Convention, first estab-
lished in 1967, committed signatory na-
tions to providing developing countries
with a minimum annual tonnage of grain
on a bilateral basis. In the 1967 FAC, 11
member countries pledged 4.26 million
tons of wheat, coarse grains, or a cash
equivalent, with the U.S. pledging 1.89
million tons. A new Food Aid Convention
was negotiated in 1971. Nine countries
agreed to contribute 4.226 million tons of
wheat and coarse grain. However, the
U.S. commitment remained at 1.89 mil-
lion tons. The 1971 FAC was extended
three times.
