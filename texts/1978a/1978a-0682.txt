Apr. 3
Administration of Jimmy Carter, 1978
Q. Is Ian Smith and the internal settle-
ment group going to be the toughest nut
to crack?
SECRETARY VANCE. Yes. We haven't
heard from them, of course, because the
invitations to attend such a meeting are
merely being extended today, and we
haven't heard anything from them yet.
And I don't expect to hear from them in
the immediate future.
Q. Do you anticipate they'll be the
most difficult to get into the meeting?
SECRETARY VANCE. I would think so,
yes, because we already heard from the
others. We know the others are going to
come.
Q. Were invitations to both meetings
going out today, Mr. Secretary?
SECRETARY VANCE. YES.
Q. Is that what you are indicating?
SECRETARY VANCE. They are.
Q. Have you sounded many out at all
on the subject?
SECRETARY VANCE. We have not, no.
As I say, the invitation will be conveyed
to him today.
Q. What is new about this from
yesterday?
SECRETARY VANCE. From yesterday, we
have now set specific times for the meet-
ing and have confirmed that the Patriotic
Front is prepared to attend both sets of
meetings, so that we have more specificity
on that. We also know that the frontline
states will attend both meetings, and that
is in addition to what we had yesterday.
And now we are are getting down to the
specifics of how to put it all together and
get it going.
where it would be is still very much up in
the air-in Africa, but where, I don't
know.
Q. Was there any reason to stress this
to Great Britain today?
SECRETARY VANCE. No, no. The British
are with us all the way on this.
Q. What are our expectations now as
far as Smith and the three internal
leaders? Do we expect that they ulti-
mately will come?
SECRETARY VANCE. Well, we certainly
hope that they will come, because if one
wants to find a way to stop the fighting,
then you have to get all of the parties to-
gether. And that's everybody's ultimate
objective, to have a cease-fire, and then to
move on to free elections. And the way to
get that is to get all the parties together
and have them sit down around the table
and agree on the transition arrangements
necessary to bring that about, to bring
about a cease-fire, and then to move on to
elections.
Q. Who else, the transition people and
the interim government?
SECRETARY VANCE. Yes, the internal
people.
Q. You haven't heard from them
either?
SECRETARY VANCE. We have not.
Q. How did you interpret paragraph
5 of page 6 or paragraph 6 of page 5,
where General Obasanjo talked about ex-
ternal groups being involved? ยน
SECRETARY VANCE. I interpret that as
being a strong statement on his part that
it is Africa's desire to settle their own
Q. What is your thought for a date on disputes in their own way, and he was
the second meeting, then?
Secretary Vance. I would hope this
is just my hope that it could be around
the 25th or 26th of April.
Q. The same place?
SECRETARY VANCE. No. I think it
would probably be in another place, but
merely emphasizing the fact that when
outside powers intervene, that this makes
the settlement of African disputes more
difficult because it gets them involved in
