Administration of Jimmy Carter, 1978
deprivation, not just of women but of the
American system.
So, I considered myself a partner with
the women of America when I asked the
Task Force to perform this work. I hope
that you will continue to look upon me
as a partner as we carry out the recom-
mendations that have been made.
At the next Cabinet meeting, this will
be on my agenda. I'll go down the list
of recommendations with the Cabinet
members, the heads of the major agen-
cies, and perhaps we'll have an immedi-
ate indication to you of tangible results.
And I would like to be sure that this re-
port does not gather dust on the shelves
of those involved, but becomes a working
document that would yield benefits not
only to you but to Amy and others in
whom I have confidence for the future.
Thank you very much.
