Administration of Jimmy Carter, 1978
May 17
So, Africa is no longer of interest only
to multinational corporations but is also
important in the maintenance of peace
the world over. President Carter's Africa
policy reflects a new realism on the part
of the American Government in dealing
with issues concerning Africa.
We in Zambia will always, Mr. Presi-
dent, support any efforts aimed at creat-
ing greater understanding, unity, and co-
operation among various peoples of the
world without regard to race, color, creed,
or station in life.
We therefore look forward to a very
fruitful visit, not only to Washington,
D.C., but to the various States in the next
few days.
Once again, Mr. President, I thank you
for this memorable and touching recep-
tion. May God bless you and all the good
people of your country and thank you.
NOTE: President Carter spoke at 10:35 a.m.
in the East Room at the White House.
