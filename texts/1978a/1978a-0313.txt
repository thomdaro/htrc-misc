The President today announced that
he will nominate Leslie L. Kanuk, of
Englewood Cliffs, N.J., to be a Federal
Maritime Commissioner. She would re-
place Clarence Morse, whose term has
expired.
Kanuk was born August 9, 1929, in

from the City College of New York in
1950, an M.B.A. from Baruch College in
1964, and a Ph. D. from the City Univer-
sity of New York in 1973.
Since 1967 Kanuk has been deputy
chairman and professor in the Depart-
ment of Marketing at Baruch College of
the City University of New York. She has
served on the maritime transportation
research board of the National Academy
of Sciences since 1975, and has served as
a consultant to the U.S. Maritime Ad-
ministration. She is the author of numer-
ous articles on maritime transportation.
American Bolt, Nut, and Large
Screw Industry
Memorandum From the President.
February 10, 1978
Memorandum for the Special Represent-
ative for Trade Negotiations
Subject: Determination Under Section
202(a) of the Trade Act; Bolts, Nuts
and Large Screws of Iron or Steel
Pursuant to section 202(b)(1) of the
Trade Act of 1974 (P.L. 93-618, 88
Stat. 1978), I have determined the ac-
tion I will take with respect to the report
of the United States International Trade
Commission (USITC), transmitted to me
on December 12, 1977, concerning the re-
sults of its investigation of a petition for
import relief filed by the United States
Fastener Manufacturing Group, the
United Steel Workers of America, and the
International Association of Machinists
and Aerospace Workers on behalf of the
domestic industry producing iron or steel
lag screws or bolts, bolts (except mine-
roof bolts) and bolts and their nuts im-
ported in the same shipment, nuts, and
screws having shanks or threads over 0.24
inch in diameter, provided for in items
646.49, 646.54, 646.56, and 646.63 of the
Tariff Schedules of the United States.
After considering all relevant aspects
of the case, including those set forth in
section 202 (c) of the Trade Act of 1974,
I have determined that provision of im-
port relief is not in the national economic
interest for the following reasons:
1. The USITC reported that domestic
producers' shipments and exports had in-
creased in 1976 and the first half of 1977.
It also indicated that domestic producers'
rates of return on sales were above the
corresponding ratios for producers of all
fabricated metal products and for all
manufacturing corporations. Further-
more, domestic producers or their wholly
owned subsidiaries imported or purchased
20-25 percent of total 1976 shipments of
imported fasteners in the United States.
The domestic industry, particularly firms
specializing in the production of automo-
tive fasteners, has and should continue to
benefit from increased U.S. consumption
of fasteners.
2. Provision of import relief would have
significantly increased costs of fasteners
for U.S. manufacturers who use fasten-
ers to produce cars, machinery, equip-
ment, and construction items. The infla-
tionary impact of providing relief could
cause unemployment in other U.S. indus-
tries, offsetting gains in fastener employ-
ment if import relief had been imposed.
