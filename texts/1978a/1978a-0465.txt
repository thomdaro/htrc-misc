United States Arms Control and
Disarmament Agency
Letter to the Speaker of the House and the
President of the Senate. March 2, 1978
Dear Mr. Speaker: (Dear Mr. President:)
I transmit herewith for consideration
of the Congress proposed legislation to
extend the appropriation authorization
for the U.S. Arms Control and Disarma-
ment Agency, together with a letter from
the Acting Director of the Agency in sup-
port of this legislation.
Stopping the arms race, both the nu-
clear arms race and the spread of in-
creasingly more advanced technology in
non-nuclear arms, may well be the single
most important task we must accomplish
to ensure national security and the sur-
vival of mankind. The U.S. Arms Con-
trol and Disarmament Agency plays a
very important part in accomplishing this
goal.
Through the Strategic Arms Limita-
tion Talks, in which it has the leading
role, the Agency is engaged in preventing
a nuclear arms race with the Soviet
Union. And at the Comprehensive Test
Ban Talks, the Agency is working to con-
trol the spread of nuclear weapons
