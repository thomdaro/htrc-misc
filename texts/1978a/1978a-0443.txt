Administration of Jimmy Carter, 1978
Feb. 28
-The Title I program will be changed
to require that economically disadvan-
taged children in private schools receive
comparable funds to those received by
public school students, with similar
needs.
-Where a school district fails to pro-
vide appropriate Federal educational
benefits under any program to eligible
private school children, authority will be
used to by-pass the district and use an-
other agency to provide constitutionally
permissible services.
Private school children must receive
fair treatment under Federal education
programs. However I cannot support a
tax credit for private elementary and sec-
ondary school tuition. First, there is grave
doubt that such a tax credit program can
meet Constitutional requirements con-
cerning separation of church and State.
Second, the Federal government provides
funding primarily to help meet the needs
of public school children who are disad-
vantaged, or handicapped, or bilingual,
or who have some other form of special
need. We do not provide general support
for public schools and it would be unfair
to extend such support, through a gen-
eral tax credit, to private schools.
I will continue to do all I can, within
Constitutional limits, to provide for full
and equitable participation of private
schools and their students in Federal edu-
cation efforts.
WOMEN'S EDUCATIONAL EQUITY ACT
In order to assist in the elimination of
sexual discrimination in education I pro-
pose to make the Women's Educational
Equity Act an independent authority
and expand its role in assisting local
school districts.
CONCLUSION
The proposals I have outlined today-
to strengthen our basic education laws,
substantially increase
increase the education
budget and undertake major organiza-
tional reform aimed at creating a Cab-
inet-level Department of Education-set
forth a far-reaching agenda for educa-
tion. These proposals are important not
only for what they offer our children
today, but for what they offer to all of us
in the future: a country that is stronger,
more united and better equipped to meet
the challenges that lie before us.
