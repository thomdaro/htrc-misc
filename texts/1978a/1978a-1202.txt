paigning for President, I said that when
Amy grows up, I'd like for her to have
just as clear a vision of being a medical
doctor as a nurse, or a lawyer as a secre-

old and later graduating to hamburgers
and homemade ice cream. [Laughter]
Amy has already started in the lemonade
business, as you may have noticed during
the halcyon days when I was a nominee

utives inspired me to call on this Task
Force to meet to investigate the present
