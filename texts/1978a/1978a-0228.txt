United States Foreign
Intelligence Activities
Statement on Executive Order 12036.
January 24, 1978
I have issued today an Executive order
concerning the organization and control
of United States foreign intelligence ac-
tivities. It is the product of the most ex-
tensive and highest level review ever con-
ducted through the National Security
Council system of our Nation's foreign in-
telligence activities and of an unprece-
dented dialog with the congressional over-
sight committees.
The new order, which builds on the ex-
perience under President Ford's Executive
Order 11905, is intended to provide a
foundation for the drafting of statutory
charters, and I intend to work closely
with congressional leaders to enact such
legislation. Until then, however, the new
order will:
-ensure that foreign intelligence and
counterintelligence activities are con-
ducted in full compliance with the
laws of the United States and are
consistent with broader national se-
curity policies;
-establish effective oversight of the
direction, management, and conduct
of the foreign intelligence activities
of the Federal Government;
-clarify the authority and responsi-
bilities of the Director of Central In-
telligence (DCI) and the depart-
ments and agencies that have foreign
intelligence and counterintelligence
responsibilities.
The most important features of the new
Executive order are as follows:
1. The National Security Council and
its two standing committees the Special
Coordination Committee (SCC) and the
Policy Review Committee (PRC)â€”will,
short of the President, provide the high-
