The President today announced the

ficers of the executive branch, 3 private
citizens, 3 U.S. Senators, 3 Members of
the House of Representatives, 4 Gover-
nors, 3 State legislators, 4 mayors, and 3

United States-Bolivia Treaty
on Penal Sentences
Message to the Senate Transmitting the
Treaty. April 14, 1978
To the Senate of the United States:
With a view to receiving the advice and
consent of the Senate to ratification, I
transmit herewith the Treaty between the
United States of America and Bolivia on
the Execution of Penal Sentences which
was signed at La Paz on February 10,
1978.
I transmit also, for the information of
the Senate, the report of the Department
of State with respect to the Treaty.
The Treaty would permit citizens of
either nation who had been convicted in
the courts of the other country to serve
their sentences in their home country; in
each case the consent of the offender as
well as the approval of the authorities of
the two Governments would be required.
This Treaty is significant because it
represents an attempt to resolve a situa-
tion which has inflicted substantial hard-
ships on a number of citizens of each
country and has caused concern to both
Governments. The Treaty is similar to
those with Mexico and Canada, to which
the Senate gave advice and consent last
year. I recommend that the Senate give
favorable consideration to this Treaty at
an early date.
