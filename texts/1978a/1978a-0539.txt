Administration of Jimmy Carter, 1978
Air Services Between the United
States and the United Kingdom
Statement by the President. March 17, 1978
I am pleased to announce that we have
been able to reach an agreement with the
United Kingdom today which will make
possible a wide range of low fares.
Budget and standby fares will be avail-
able on scheduled flights between the
United Kingdom and 14 United States
gateway cities. These cities are: Anchor-
age, Alaska; Atlanta, Ga.; Boston, Mass.;
Chicago, Ill.; Dallas/Ft. Worth, Tex.;
Detroit, Mich.; Houston, Tex.; Los An-
geles, Calif.; Miami, Fla.; New York
City, N.Y.; Philadelphia, Pa.; San Fran-
cisco, Calif.; Seattle, Wash.; and Wash-
ington/Baltimore.
This agreement also liberalizes charter
rules and ensures charter rate freedom.
All this will encourage air travel between
the United States and the United King-
dom.
Taken together, these two agreements
constitute a major step forward in imple-
menting our key objective in international
aviation-to provide the traveling public
with a wide choice of low fares on sched-
uled flights.
The agreement also demonstrates once
again that we can work out difficulties
with our most important aviation partner
to the mutual benefit of airlines and con-
sumers in both the United States and the
United Kingdom.
