Apr. 28
Administration of Jimmy Carter, 1978
affairs of elected office, that we can work
in harmony even in very controversial
times, and although there's a slight mal-
aise and a distrust of government left over
from the previous administration, we
Democrats are going to correct that if we
work together in the future.
Thank you very much, God bless you.
One other thing I want to say: I love
every one of you.
Thank you very much.
MRS. CARTER. I just want to welcome
you to the White House and tell you how
glad I am that you're here.
I look around and see so many faces
of people that I walked up and down the
streets with and campaigned with. And I
want you to know that this house belongs
to you as much as it does to us, and we
know that we wouldn't be here if it had
not been for your help.
Another thing, as Jimmy said, we need
your continuing help, because you can
not only influence your representatives in
Congress but you can help us influence
public opinion, the people around you.
You're organized, you're strong, and we
have to have the public opinion on
our side as we work together to make our
country a better place to live and to work
and to play. So we need you, we need
your help. And welcome to the White
House.
THE PRESIDENT. Joan Mondale has
already made a talk to you, but I want to
let you know that we've been blessed
here in the White House and in the Oval
Office with the best pair of partners that
anyone ever had. There is no decision
that I make that's not shared with Fritz
Mondale. There's no information that
I have about the most top-secret interna-
tional and sensitive issues that he doesn't
share with me completely. I have never
had a meeting since I've been President
from which he was excluded, and he has
never disappointed me at all.
One thing that I would like to see us
all do together this year is get the equal
rights amendment passed. Okay? [Ap-
plause]
Goodbye, everybody. See you all later.
NOTE: The President spoke at 4:48 p.m. in
the East Room at the White House to dele-
gates to the National Federation's 1978
convention.
