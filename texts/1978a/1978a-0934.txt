We are delighted to have you all here
tonight to welcome to the White House a
great leader.
Many of you didn't recognize the lan-
guage of the
of the prayer that was given by our
guest. It was Presbyterian. [Laughter] His
father was a pastor, a minister in the
Church of Scotland. And I think that it's
obvious to all of us that our guest has very
deep feelings, not only about religion but
about humanity, about freedom, about
individuality, equality, democracy, self-
expression, the very same characteristics
of life that have made our own Nation
great and have made the nation of Zam-
bia great.
Living in this house is sometimes a
sobering experience, because you look
back over many years and see the leaders
who have been here. We revere George
Washington because he had such great
courage and tenacity and confidence in
his own people, that he was the father of
our country. And it's a very exciting thing
to know that we have, in effect, the
George Washington of Zambia here with
us tonight, a man who had the confidence
of his people and who enjoys a relation-
ship with the people of Zambia that's
mutually respectful and filled with con-
fidence.

kind of man he is. I know the leadership
