International Sugar
Agreement, 1977
Message to the Senate Transmitting the
Agreement. January 25, 1978
To the Senate of the United States:
I transmit herewith the International
Sugar Agreement, 1977, accompanied by
the report of the Department of State.
Ambassador Young signed this Agreement
on behalf of the United States of America
on December 9, 1977.
The Agreement seeks to stabilize sugar
prices to meet both our domestic inter-
ests as a major consumer and producer of
sugar, and our international interests as
the world's largest importer of sugar. The
United States has been a member of pre-
vious international sugar agreements, in-
cluding the first one in 1937. But we were
not a member of the most recent, which
was negotiated in 1968 and expired in
1973. Serious negotiations for this new
Agreement began last April when sugar
prices were low and surpluses were large.
High prices during 1974 and 1975 had
stimulated world production, cut world
demand, and encouraged the develop-
ment of high fructose corn syrup, a direct
competitor with beet and cane sugar.
The new Agreement is designed to
avoid the problems created by excess sup-
plies of sugar, while providing assurances
of adequate supplies in the future. It does
so by stabilizing world prices between 11
and 21 cents a pound. The 11 cent mini-
mum will be defended by a worldwide
system of export quotas. The Food and
Agriculture Act of 1977 establishes a do-
mestic support price of 13.5 cents per
pound which is roughly equivalent to the
11 cent minimum world price when nor-
mal duties and transportation are added.
When domestic prices rise above that
level, the Secretary of Agriculture may
suspend the price support program.
The Agreement protects the interests of
consumers by guarding against high prices
and ensuring adequate supplies for do-
mestic needs. It calls for reserve stocks
under which about 2.5 million tons of
sugar will be set aside and held in export-
ing countries for release in case prices ap-
proach the 21 cent level. The 11 cent
price will encourage sufficient investment
to avoid sharp reductions in supplies and
concomitant price increases.
The Agreement is consistent with our
broad foreign policy objectives and with
our intent to balance the interests of pro-
ducing and consuming countries through
international cooperation. Once in full
operation, it should eliminate the need
for the tariff and fee measures recently
imposed to defend our domestic price
support program. Such unilateral meas-
ures adversely affect the earning capacity
of many developing countries and under-
mine our commitment to an open interna-
tional trading system. Instead, the Agree-
ment represents a cooperative effort
among sugar exporting and importing
countries to achieve their mutual interests
