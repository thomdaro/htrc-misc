Administration of Jimmy Carter, 1978
fer of functionsâ€”not merely for storage
purposes the receiving agency shall be
deemed to be the originating agency for
all purposes under this Order.
3-202. For classified information not
transferred in accordance with Section 3-
201, but originated in an agency which
has ceased to exist, each agency in pos-
session shall be deemed to be the origi-
nating agency for all purposes under this
Order. Such information may be declassi-
fied or downgraded by the agency in pos-
session after consulting with any other
agency having an interest in the subject
matter.
3-203. Classified information trans-
ferred to the General Services Adminis-
tration for accession into the Archives of
the United States shall be declassified or
downgraded by the Archivist of the
United States in accordance with this Or-
der, the directives of the Information Se-
curity Oversight Office, and the agency
guidelines.
3-204. After the termination of a Presi-
dential administration, the Archivist of
the United States shall review and de-
classify or downgrade all information
classified by the President, the White
House Staff, committees or commissions
appointed by the President, or others act-
ing on the President's behalf. Such de-
classification shall only be undertaken in
accordance with the provisions of Section
3-504.
3-3. Declassification Policy.
3-301. Declassification of classified in-
formation shall be given emphasis com-
parable to that accorded classification.
Information classified pursuant to this
and prior Orders shall be declassified as
early as national security considerations
permit. Decisions concerning declassifica-
tion shall be based on the loss of the in-
formation's sensitivity with the passage of
time or on the occurrence of a declassifica-
tion event.
3-302. When information is reviewed
for declassification pursuant to this Order
or the Freedom of Information Act, it
shall be declassified unless the declassifica-
tion authority established pursuant to Sec-
tion 3-1 determines that the information
continues to meet the classification re-
quirements prescribed in Section 1-3
despite the passage of time.
3-303. It is presumed that information
which continues to meet the classifica-
tion requirements in Section 1-3 requires
continued protection. In some cases, how-
ever, the need to protect such information
may be outweighed by the public interest
in disclosure of the information, and in
these cases the information should be de-
classified. When such questions arise, they
shall be referred to the agency head, a
senior agency official with responsibility
for processing Freedom of Information
Act requests or Mandatory Review re-
quests under this Order, an official with
Top Secret classification authority, or the
Archivist of the United States in the case
of material covered in Section 3-503.
That official will determine whether the
public interest in disclosure outweighs the
damage to national security that might
reasonably be expected from disclosure.
3-4. Systematic Review for Declassifi-
cation.
3-401. Classified information constitut-
ing permanently valuable records of the
Government, as defined by 44 U.S.C.
2103, and information in the possession
and control of the Administrator of Gen-
eral Services, pursuant to 44 U.S.C. 2107
or 2107 note, shall be reviewed for de-
classification as it becomes twenty years
old. Agency heads listed in Section 1-2
and officials designated by the President
