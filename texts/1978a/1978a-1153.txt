pro-
handled separately by the Veterans Af-
fairs Committees of the House and Senate.
I very much hope that your Committee
will be able to act favorably on these
posals in veterans Federal employment
policy. Such changes will serve the public
interest and are long overdue. They are a
vital part of the effort to make govern-
ment more efficient and responsive to the
American people.
I am sending a copy of this letter to all
members of the Committee.
Sincerely,
JIMMY CARTER
[The Honorable Robert Nix, Chairman, House
Post Office and Civil Service Committee, U.S.

Fourth of July
Statement by the President. June 21, 1978
The Fourth of July is a time of celebra-
tion for all Americans, as we commemo-
rate the bold actions of those who brought
our Nation into being 202 years ago to-
day.
We celebrate on this day the benefits of
freedom which Americans have struggled
to establish and died to preserve. But since
we are aware that not all people share our
good fortune to live in a country founded
on liberty, the Fourth of July is also an
occasion to rededicate ourselves to the
pursuit everywhere of the human rights
for which our Nation has always stood.
In 1978, we face these responsibilities,
proud of our heritage and confident that
our belief in freedom will carry us for-
ward in the years ahead.
