those samples examples of petroleum-
related discharges, of area-source dis-

manent recycling center that they've
established, primarily for aluminum, and
they've done noise studies in their own
classroom areas to make sure that noise
pollution is both recognized and reduced.
This is something that could be impor-
tant as a project for schools throughout
the country, because quite often, we don't
Ms. BLUM. Steven Michael Mensing, realize how high the noise level comes
Mr. President.
THE PRESIDENT. Steven? Tell me how
the quality of-Beaver Creek, right?
MR. MENSING. Right.
THE PRESIDENT. How's the quality
changed since you've been doing your
tests at all?
MR. MENSING. Since I've begun my
tests, an oil pump has been removed, so
that's going to take away some of the
problems.
THE PRESIDENT. Very good. Make
sure everybody in your community knows
what they can do to make Beaver Creek
a purer and more beautiful stream. Good
luck to you.
MR. MENSING. Thank you, Mr. Presi-
dent.
MR. COSTLE. Mr. President, the next
award winners are from Ballou Senior
High School here in Washington. And
they have been interested in a variety of
things. Most notably they've started a
major recycling center, and they're re-
cycling aluminum. I think they've already
recycled on the order of 10,000 cans.
They also took an interest in noise prob-
lems, and they've made a number of rec-
ommendations, as I understand it, that
the school's actually adopted, that have
in fact reduced the noise levels with
which they have to contend. And we're
particularly proud of this group.
Ms. BLUM. Mr. President, Donna
Cunningham.
THE PRESIDENT. Donna, congratula-
tions to you. I'm very proud of you.
I might point out that this is a per-
and how disturbing it can be, not only to
concentration on studies but also actually
to the health of the students involved.
Ms. BLUM. And the second person on
the project, Leslie Only.
THE PRESIDENT. Leslie, good luck to
you, and thank you for the good work
you've done.
MR. COSTLE. Mr. President, our final
group is from B.M.C. Durfee High
School in Fall River, Massachusetts.
Now, they've been involved in an on-
going committee effort at the school for
over 3 years. Their first area of interest
was water quality, and they've done a
number of surveys in that area. They've
more recently gotten interested in the
solid waste problems of the city, and
they've spent time at the municipal in-
cinerator, they've done air sampling at
that incinerator, and they've come up
with a number of very concrete sugges-
tions on how to introduce resource re-
covery in that area and to improve the
way the garbage problem is in fact
handled.
Ms. BLUM. Mr. President, may I pre-
sent Mary Ellen Gurnett.
THE PRESIDENT. Mary Ellen, congratu-
lations to you.
Ms. BLUM. And this is Richard
Mechaber.
THE PRESIDENT. Richard, congratula-
tions.
Ms. BLUM. Ann Marie Medeiros.
THE PRESIDENT. Ann Marie, thank
you for coming.
Ms. BLUM. Frances Melvin.
