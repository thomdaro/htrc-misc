Administration of Jimmy Carter, 1978
Mar. 17
number one export item, and we ship most
of our tobacco up to places like Winston-
Salem to be produced into smoking prod-
ucts and other uses of tobacco.
So, I would say that there's a well-bal-
anced campaign to protect the health of
our Nation, which is Joe Califano's direct
responsibility, on the one hand, and to
preserve the health and stability of the
tobacco industry, which is under Bob
Bergland, Secretary of Agriculture, and
myself.
I don't think there needs to be any
concern about that, and nobody need
fear the facts about tobacco use. Cer-
tainly, no one need fear the emphasis on
research that will make the use of to-
bacco in the future even more safe than
it has been in the past.
WILMINGTON 10
Q. Will the White House get involved
with the Wilmington 10 case, intervene
at all?
THE PRESIDENT. Not as far as I know.
This is a State case, as you know. The
only circumstances under which the Fed-
eral Government would get involved
would be through the court system, if
there was an appeal made to the Federal
courts.
DESEGREGATION OF SOUTHERN
UNIVERSITIES
Q. Will you get involved in the de-
segregation issue?
THE PRESIDENT. Well, the desegrega-
tion issue applies to many Southern
States at the university level, I presume
you mean.
Q. Yes.
THE PRESIDENT. When I became
President and brought in my Cabinet, we
were faced with a lawsuit-I think the
man's name is Judge Pratt, in Washing-
ton—that required me and the Secretary
of HEW to bring about a resolution of
a dispute in the university system of some
Southern States concerning the percent-
age of black students who go to school
in white university component portions,
and also vice versa. We've already
reached agreement with Oklahoma, with
Georgia, and with Arkansas, South Caro-
lina, Florida. We are now working in
the last stages of the resolution of the
question with Virginia. This leaves North
Carolina.
¹
And Bill Friday and Governor Hunt.
and Bob Morgan and others, Steve,
have been to see me about this. We are
trying to negotiate in good faith with the
North Carolina university officials. And
we have to comply with the Federal court
orders, and we have to ensure that there
are no remnants of discrimination against
black people.
I think this is a commitment that I
share with North Carolina people. How
to go about resolving the differences in
the court is something that is being
negotiated in good faith.
When I came in from the airport this
morning with your Governor, Jim Hunt,
he expressed his conviction to me that this
issue would be resolved very soon in the
future. There's no incompatibility there.
It's a lingering thing that has been going
on in the courts for many years, and we
hope to have it cleared up within the
next few weeks.
Q. Do you think you'll grant an exten-
sion on the Monday deadline?
THE PRESIDENT. I don't know any-
thing about the legal aspects of it. I
couldn't answer that.
Q. Califano's deadline is for Monday,
though.
¹Dr. William C. Friday, president, Sixteen
Consolidated Universities of North Carolina,
and Senator Robert Morgan and Representa-
tive Stephen L. Neal, both of North Carolina.
