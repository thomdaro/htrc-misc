that we have common interests, common
principles, and common ideals."
as well as English, the Bible tells us that to
whom much is given, much will be re-
quired. Our two nations have been greatly
blessed by God, and we have much to give
in return.
Thank you very much.
Those words still apply today, and
they are the overriding concepts which
bind our nations together permanently
and on which we base our realization and
our hope and our expectation for future
friendship, stability, and mutual strength- Chamber of Deputies of the Congress. In his
ening in the years to come.
In the intervening years, Brazil has
come into an even fuller realization of
your rightful place in the world, though
it has not yet reached the limits of your
enormous potential. And after all those
years, we can still call on one another as
friends, for that bond recalls the sacri-
fices that we have made together in a
common struggle, with the loss of Bra-
zilian and American lives, and it implies
the right to disagree on occasion, even
vigorously, without bitterness or mistrust.
As I said when I met your President
yesterday, the world needs, the world
expects, and the world will benefit from
your creativity, your energy, and your suc-
cess. Many of the problems that we share
as members of a human family will never
be solved unless the ablest among us de-
vote their best to efforts to that cause.
Economic development with a fairer dis-
tribution of the world's riches, a trading
system that is open and equitable, cooper-
ative solutions to our common energy
problems, peaceful use of atomic power
without the risk of proliferation, reducing
the excessive trade in weapons, and en-
couraging consultations and negotiations
about even the most troubling issues, ad-
vancing the cause of human liberty, dem-
ocratic government, and the rule of law-
these are efforts in which the United
States needs your friendship, your part-
nership, and the world needs your help
and your leadership. And I'm sure we
will not be disappointed.
Since my friend has quoted the Bible, I
would like to do the same. In Portuguese,
