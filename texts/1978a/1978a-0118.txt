Jan. 19
Administration of Jimmy Carter, 1978
Teenage Pregnancy Proposal
I will propose legislation to establish
networks of community based services to
prevent unwanted adolescent pregnan-
cies. We need and will urge expansion of
existing family planning services to reach
an additional 280,000 teenagers.
Drug Abuse
Drug Abuse threatens the health and
safety of our children, here and abroad.
We will continue the efforts begun last
year to make our drug abuse prevention
and control programs more effective and
efficient.
World Health
This year I will present a strategy for
working directly with other nations and
through international organizations to
raise the standards of health and nutrition
around the world.
EDUCATION
Last year the Congress adopted with
our cooperation a 15% increase in edu-
cation funding the largest increase since
enactment of the Elementary and Second-
ary Education Act.
This year we will continue to demon-
strate our commitment to improving the
Nation's education programs. HEW's ed-
ucation budget expenditures will be in-
creased by 14%, with the most significant
increases coming in education of the dis-
advantaged, assistance to State programs
for education of the handicapped, and
college student financial aid.
The Administration will also work with
the Congress for the creation of a sepa-
rate Cabinet-level Department of Edu-
cation, and for legislation to replace and
reform expiring Federal education acts.
These legislative proposals will con-
centrate on:
-increasing basic literacy;
-ensuring that students are prepared
for jobs;
-supporting post-secondary education
and lifelong learning; and,
-strengthening the partnership be-
tween Federal, State, and local gov-
ernments.
To augment existing programs, I will
propose legislation to help low and
middle-income families meet rising col-
lege tuition costs, and will also support a
significant expansion of student aid pro-
grams.
INCOME ASSISTANCE
Over the past year we have made many
far-reaching improvements in the pro-
grams that provide income assistance to
the needy. My Administration will con-
tinue to assign great importance to this
area in 1978.
Welfare Reform
I proposed last year a reform of the
Nation's welfare system, through the Bet-
ter Jobs and Income Act. This Act would
fundamentally reform current programs
to assist the poor by:
-consolidating the Aid to Families
with Dependent Children, Supple-
mental Security Income and Food
Stamps programs into a single con-
solidated cash assistance program
that provides a basic nationally uni-
form Federal benefit;
-improving efforts to find jobs for the
poor in the private sector, and creat-
ing up to 1.4 million public service
jobs for heads of families who can-
not be placed in unsubsidized em-
ployment; and
-improving work incentives by ex-
panding the Earned Income Tax
Credit.
