signed by the Office of Telecommunica-
tions Policy and the Department of Com-
merce on behalf of the administration. It
urged the FCC to establish a policy pro-
moting ownership of broadcast facilities

cense processing so that more broadcast
properties and funding prospects would
be available for minority applicants.
