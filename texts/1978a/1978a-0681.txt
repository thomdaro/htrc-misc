The President's Trip to Africa
Remarks During a Briefing for Reporters on
Board Air Force One en Route to Monrovia,
Liberia. April 3, 1978
SECRETARY OF STATE VANCE. Why
don't we start off by talking about the re-
lease which was just issued on the meet-
ings which the United Kingdom and
ourselves are going to call on the Rho-
desian question.
As we announced this morning, this
follows the meetings which the President
had with General Obasanjo and which I
subsequently had with the foreign min-
isters of several of the frontline states. As
we indicated, there will be two meetings.
The first of the meetings will be with
the participants to the Malta Conference,
namely, with the leaders of the Patriotic
Front, plus the Foreign Ministers of the
frontline states and Namibia, who will be
invited to attend as well.
That will lead up to an all-parties
meeting which we hope to have with all
of the parties to the Rhodesian matter.
As to the dates on which these meetings
will be held and the exact places, they are
being worked out with the respective par-
ties in the capitals. The first meeting, I
would hope, would take place around
April 15. If that's convenient to all of the
parties, that would be convenient for both
David Owen and myself and Andy Young,
who will be there, and it would also be
convenient to the foreign ministers of the
frontline states in Namibia.
We have not heard yet whether that
will be a convenient date for the leaders
of the Patriotic Front, and I also will have
to check with the Secretary General to-
morrow to see whether General Prem
Chand can attend on that date.
Q. Is he head of the OAU?
SECRETARY VANCE. No. Prem Chand is
the U.N. Representative who was ap-
pointed by the Secretary General to work
on the Rhodesian problem and to report
back to the Secretary General and the Se-
curity Council.
Q. Where would this meeting be, at
the U.N.?
SECRETARY VANCE. No. It will be in
Africa. The final place of the meeting has
not yet been selected. But if I had to
guess, I would guess it's going to be in
Dar Es Salaam.
Q. That means you will have to go
back.
SECRETARY VANCE. That means I'll
have to go back.
Q. Shortly?
SECRETARY VANCE. Shortly.
Q. Oh, joy. [Laughter] Strike that.
[Laughter]
SECRETARY VANCE. As I say, the invita-
tions are being conveyed to the various
parties by the British and American
representatives today.
Q. Have you sounded out anyone pre-
liminary to the invitations to see whether
they'd accept them or not?
SECRETARY VANCE. I am informed that
the leaders of the Patriotic Front have
agreed to attend such a meeting and to
also attend-
Q. The leaders of the Patriotic Front?
SECRETARY VANCE. And when I say
such a meeting, I mean both the meeting,
the preliminary meeting with the leaders
of the Patriotic Front, and an all-parties
meeting as well.
