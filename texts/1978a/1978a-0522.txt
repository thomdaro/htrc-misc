Administration of Jimmy Carter, 1978
pension orders issued by the Governor be
terminated effective on the day of that
rescission. The Administrator of the En-
vironmental Protection Agency retains
full authority to disapprove temporary
suspensions of regulations in Alabama
and to exercise his emergency powers au-
thority under Section 303 of the Clean Air
Act, when and if necessary.
I urge the Governor to act with due
care if he suspends air pollution regula-
tions under the authority provided by this
determination, since such regulations are
important to protect public health. I urge
the Governor to consider carefully that
suspensions which would allow a facility
to burn available fuel which could not
otherwise be utilized generally are appro-
priate. On the other hand, suspensions
which permit facilities to turn off pollu-
tion control devices should be used spar-
ingly and as a last resort, because such
suspensions will accomplish only small en-
ergy savings while increasing risks to
public health.
I also urge the Governor to implement
fully necessary energy conservation meas-
ures so that the necessity for suspension
of pollution control regulations can be
minimized.
