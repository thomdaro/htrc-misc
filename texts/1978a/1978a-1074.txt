Anti-Inflation Policy
Remarks on the Administration's Anti-
Inflation Policy. June 8, 1978
The most serious problem that our
Nation has is inflation, and it's getting
worse. It's absolutely imperative that
Americans commit themselves, all of us, to
a common sacrifice to control this rapid
increase in prices.
I don't think it's going to be effective
to ask other Americans to join in this
effort for their own benefit unless the
Congress, the President, and the entire
Federal Government is willing to set an
example here in Washington.
The Congress is now considering, for
instance, legislation to control hospital
costs. There has been an enormous in-
crease in profits by people who own and
operate private hospitals. Costs have been
going up 17 percent a year, more than
twice as rapidly as the cost of other prod-
ucts and services in our country.
