National Education Association
Remarks at a White House Reception for the
Association's Board of Directors.
February 10, 1978
Well, I feel like I'm among friends.
It's a great honor for me and for my
family to have you here in the White
House. It's a place where you belong, and
it belongs to you. Every one of the Presi-
dents since George Washington have lived
here. And the problems and opportuni-
ties faced by us have been exactly the ones
that were faced on a much more personal
and daily basis by the teachers of our
Nation for the last 200 years.
There's an inherent partnership be-
tween those who serve in government at
all levels and those who teach our stu-
dents, both young and old.
I'm very delighted that the NEA chose
to take an active role in politics-
[laughter]â€”at that very propitious time.
I felt at that moment that Fritz Mondale
and I had formed an alliance or a friend-
ship and a sense of mutual trust that
would stand us in good stead as we deal
with national problems. And I hope that
as we progress through our own admin-
istration, that that realization might grow
in your mind if you have friends here in
the White House as well.
We do have a good program going.
Our emphasis this year will be on basic
educational quality, and we're trying in
a special way to make opportunities avail-
able for high school graduates to go on
to college.
