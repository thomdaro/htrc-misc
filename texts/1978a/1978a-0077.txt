year budget plan. Work on these should
commence immediately after the FY 1979
budget is transmitted.
The Office of Management and
Budget will give you the 1979 allowances
and the planning base estimates for fiscal
years 1980, 1981, and 1982. These will be
based on your projections for the FY 1979
budget. Then, in the spring, I will review
major FY 1980 budget issues that might
significantly alter the three-year planning
base estimate. Afterwards the Office of
Management and Budget will give you
detailed guidance (and if necessary, re-
vised planning base estimates) as you
undertake the preparation of your fall
budget request.
I realize that some issues will occa-
sionally arise during the year which I
will not have had a chance to consider in
these comprehensive spring and fall
budget reviews. When this happens I
want an analysis of long-term budget
costs to be included among the briefing
papers I receive.
Multi-year budget planning should
help make our government work better.
I know you will do everything possible to
see that the transition is smooth.

JIMMY CARTER
Statement on the Death of the Senator From
Montana. January 12, 1978
The death of Senator Lee Metcalf stills
a voice that had long spoken up for pre-
serving the great wilderness areas of this
country. He came from the land of the
Big Sky, of wide plains and rugged moun-
tains, where a traveler can go for miles
without meeting another person. He was a
friend of working people and family
farmers and an early sponsor of legislation
for clean water, Federal aid to education,
and reclamation of strip-mined land. He
was beginning his 18th year in the Sen-
ate, after 8 years in the House and 6 years
as a Montana supreme court justice.
During his nearly 25 years on Capitol
Hill, he had become a guardian of the
public interest in dealing with the utilities
and an advocate of congressional reform
and budgetary control.
His loss will be deeply felt.
