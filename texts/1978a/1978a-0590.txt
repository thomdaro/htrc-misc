Mar. 27
Administration of Jimmy Carter, 1978
At the same time, however, I must
express my serious concerns with the ex-
traordinary worker protection provisions
contained in H.R. 3813. During the con-
sideration of this bill, this administration
repeatedly stated its firm resolve to ensure
that the full range of existing Federal as-
sistance benefits would be made available
to individuals and communities adversely
affected by the park expansion. I believe
that in the absence of overriding national
policy considerations, all workers who
have lost their jobs through no fault of
their own should be treated equally by the
Federal Government.
While I am signing H.R. 3813 for the
purpose of providing needed protection
for Redwood National Park, this action
in no way constitutes an endorsement by
this administration of special worker ben-
efits programs in future legislation.
NOTE: As enacted, H.R. 3813 is Public Law

Federal Coal Mine
Health Activities
Message to the Congress Transmitting a
Report. March 27, 1978
To the Congress of the United States:
I transmit herewith the 1975 Annual
Report of Health Activities under the
Federal Coal Mine Health and Safety
Act of 1969.
I recommend that the statutory report-
ing requirement for this report be changed
from once every year to once every three
years. Department of Health, Education,
and Welfare staff resources and time could
be better spent on more research rather
than on the preparation of annual reports
of largely repetitious material. Basic in-
formation in this field has been known for
