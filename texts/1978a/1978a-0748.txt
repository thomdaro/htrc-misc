Administration of Jimmy Carter, 1978
I wondered whether you regard that as an
appropriate reason for deciding not to
prosecute a law enforcement officer who
violates the law?
THE PRESIDENT. I don't know whether
or not they will be, whether their names
will be made public. I'll have to ask the
Attorney General about this. I don't know
the legalities of it. I think that Griffin Bell
made the right decision. He made it on
his own-without consultation with me,
by the way to prosecute the ones who
issued the orders.
Obviously there are some instances in
the military and otherwise when a hei-
nous crime, when committed by someone
under orders, should be punished. But I
think in this case the Attorney General
made the right decision.
MR. PATTERSON. Thank you, Mr.
President.
NOTE: President Carter's twenty-ninth news
conference began at 1:56 p.m. in the Inter-
national Ballroom West at the Washington Hil-
ton Hotel. It was broadcast live on radio and
television.
