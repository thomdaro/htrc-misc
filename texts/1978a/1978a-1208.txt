June 29
Administration of Jimmy Carter, 1978
The standard for classification has been
tightened. No document is to be classified
unless its release reasonably could be ex-
pected to cause identifiable damage to the
national security. Insignificant damage is
not a basis for classification. In addition,
the number of agencies and officials with
classification authority is being reduced.
Delegation of such authority shall be held
to a minimum.
me on compliance with the order. The
Office is a key element to the new clas-
sification system, and it will have my
strong support.
In a break from precedent, this order
was drafted in consultation with several
congressional committees and private
groups. I particularly wish to thank Sen-
ators James Abourezk, Joseph Biden,
Edmund Muskie, and Representatives
Edward Boland and Richardson Preyer
for their valuable assistance.
All documents should be declassified as
early as national security permits. Under
the new order, most documents will be
declassified after no more than 6 years.
Only agency heads and officials with "Top
Secret" classification authority may clas- National Security Information
sify for a longer period and only by indi-
cating why classification will remain nec-
essary despite the passage of time. With a
few exceptions, the documents given ex-
tended classification will be declassified
after no more than 20 years. The millions
of documents classified under prior orders
that are over 20 years old will be reviewed
and-in almost all cases-released as
quickly as possible.
I expect all officials to follow these
procedures and the others set out in the
new order. But experience has taught us
that strong oversight is needed, both to
make the classification system as open as
possible and to safeguard properly classi-
fied documents. Each agency that handles
classified information should take care to
ensure that its personnel understand and
follow the new procedures.
In addition, I have created an Informa-
tion Security Oversight Office to provide
overall supervision. This Office will have
authority to review agencies' procedures
and files. It can overrule their regulations
and their decisions on classification of in-
dividual documents, subject to appeal to
the National Security Council. The Office
will report regularly to the NSC and to

By the authority vested in me as Presi-
dent by the Constitution and laws of the
United States of America, in order to bal-
ance the public's interest in access to
Government information with the need to
protect certain national security informa-
tion from disclosure, it is hereby ordered
