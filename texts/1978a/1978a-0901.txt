National Historic Preservation
Week, 1978
Proclamation 4569. May 10, 1978
By the President of the United States
of America
A Proclamation
America's ability to meet the chal-
lenges of its third century with confidence
and strength will depend upon an ap-
preciation and understanding by the
American people of their past.
Among our most important links with
the past are the historic sites, structures,
and landmarks of earlier times. Together,
they form a vast legacy of cultural re-
sources. This legacy, however, is not
merely one of monuments, battlefields,
and historic buildings. It includes the
houses, streets, stores and factories that
make up our communitiesâ€”those familiar
places and structures that remind us of
the accomplishments, character, and
dreams of our forebears.
For our own sake, and for that of future
generations of Americans, we must do all
that lies within our power to preserve this
cultural heritage.
NOW, THEREFORE, I, JIMMY CARTER,
President of the United States of America,
do hereby proclaim the week beginning
May 7, 1978, as National Historic Pres-
ervation Week. I call upon Government
agencies at all levels, interested private
individuals and organizations, and Amer-
icans everywhere, to mark this observance
with appropriate ceremonies and activi-
ties in their communities and neighbor-
hoods.
IN WITNESS WHEREOF, I have here-
unto set my hand this tenth day of May,
in the year of our Lord nineteen hun-
dred seventy-eight, and of the Independ-
ence of the United States of America the
two hundred and second.
JIMMY CARTER
