the States and the appropriate officials of
all other areas under the United States
flag to issue similar proclamations.
I also encourage the medical and

groups to take this opportunity to educate
the people on this subject and to help
them to take advantage of available re-

death.
IN WITNESS WHEREOF, I have here-
unto set my hand this fifteenth day of
March, in the year of our Lord nineteen
