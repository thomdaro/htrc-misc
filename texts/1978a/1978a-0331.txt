Administration of Jimmy Carter, 1978
Feb. 16
Clean Air Act within 1 week of this
determination. If, during the period of
suspension, I determine that a regional
energy emergency no longer exists in In-
diana, I will direct that the temporary
suspension be terminated promptly. The
Administrator of the Environmental Pro-
tection Agency retains full authority to
disapprove temporary suspensions of reg-
ulations in Indiana and to exercise his
emergency powers authority under Sec-
tion 303 of the Clean Air Act, when and
if necessary.
I urge the Governor to act with due
care if he suspends air pollution regula-
tions under the authority provided by this
determination, since such regulations are
important to protect public health.
I also urge the Governor to implement
fully all necessary energy conservation
measures, including those power curtail-
ment orders cited in the petition, so that
the necessity for suspension of pollution
control regulations can be minimized.
