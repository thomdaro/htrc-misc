through measures that will inhibit their
further development. The Agency is also
involved in researching techniques for
preventing the unintended spread of nu-
clear weapon materials through the nu-
clear fuel cycle and in controlling the
transfer of conventional weapons and
advanced technology.
Additionally, the Agency engages in
research which supports on-going arms
control negotiations and explores pos-
sibilities for further progress and new ini-
tiatives in arms control.
Current authorization and appropria-
tions for the U.S. Arms Control and Dis-
armament Agency expire September 30,
1978. I am transmitting the attached
draft bill in order that the Congress may
begin its consideration of future author-
izing legislation for the Agency. I urge
the early enactment of this legislation.
Sincerely,
