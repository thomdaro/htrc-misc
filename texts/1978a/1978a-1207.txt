Administration of Jimmy Carter, 1978
June 29
Senator Sparkman just came in. I
wanted to recognize him. Senator, would
you stand up? Virginiaâ€”thank you very
much-and Congresswoman Virginia
Smith. We are very eager and pleased to
have the Members of Congress partici-
pate thoroughly, because there could not
possibly be a more representative group.
And their voice can be heard almost im-
mediately over the country collectively,
and they can also give us what these chil-
dren have just given us, a very good feed-
back from the children around the
Nation. We're not just teachers but we
are also students.
Both these letters, I notice, express the
children's hope for peace, which is obvi-
ously the prime hope of all of us.
Thank you very much.
NOTE: The President spoke at 1:35 p.m. in
the Rose Garden at the White House.

National Security Information
Statement on Issuing Executive Order 12065.
June 29, 1978
I am pleased to sign the Executive order
revamping the Government's security
classification system.
The public is entitled to know as much
as possible about the Government's ac-
tivities. Classification should be used only
to protect legitimate national security se-
crets and never to cover up mistakes or
improper activities.
While some material must be classified,
the Government classifies too much infor-
mation, classifies it too highly and for too
long. These practices violate the public's
right to know, impose unnecessary costs,
and weaken protection for truly sensitive
information by undermining respect for
all classification.
The new order will increase openness
in Government by limiting classification
and accelerating declassification. At the
same time, it will improve protection for
information that needs to be kept secret.
