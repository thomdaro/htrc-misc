United States Space Activities
Announcement of Administration Review.
June 20, 1978
The President directed under a Presi-
dential review memorandum that the
NSC Policy Review Committee (PRC)
thoroughly review existing policy and for-
mulate overall principles which should
guide our space activities. The major con-
cerns that prompted this review arose
from growing interaction among our var-
ious space activities.
This review examined and the resultant
Presidential directive establishes:
-A Government policy oversight sys-
tem to review and revise space policy
as needed;
-Ground rules for the balance and in-
teraction among our space programs
to ensure achievement of the inter-
related national security, economic,
political, and arms limitation goals
of the United States; and
Modifications to existing policies, the
appropriate extent of the overlap-
ping technology, and product dissem-
ination by the sectors.
This Presidential directive establishes
an NSC Policy Review Committee to pro-
vide a forum to all Federal agencies for
their policy views, to advise on proposed
changes to national space policy, to re-
solve issues referred to the Committee,
and to provide for rapid referral of issues
to the President for decision as necessary.
This Committee will be chaired by the
Director of the Office of Science and
Technology Policy, Frank Press. Recog-
nizing that the civilian space program is
at the threshold of change, the President
has asked the PRC to assess the needs and
aspirations of the Nation's civil space pro-
gram. The United States has built a broad
national base in space and aeronautics. At
issue is how best to capitalize on prior in-
vestments and set the needed direction
and purpose for continued vitality in the
future.
Under the Presidential review memo-
randum the emphasis was to resolve po-
tential conflicts among the various space
program sectors and to recommend coher-
ent space principles and national space
policy. In focusing upon these issues, the
Policy Review Committee concluded that
