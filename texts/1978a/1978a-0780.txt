Passover
Statement by the President. April 21, 1978
In Jewish tradition and practice, to-
night is the night that is different from all
other nights: the beginning of Passover,
the Festival of Freedom.
Passover commemorates a particular
struggle in a particular time and place.
But its meaning is universal. It is a re-
minder to all of us-Jews and non-Jews
alikeâ€”that the struggle for freedom and
against oppression must forever be re-
newed.
Little more than a generation ago, the
Holocaust-perhaps the cruelest chapter
in the long history of man's inhumanity
to man-took the lives of 6 million men,
women, and children. And 35 years ago
today, in the streets of the Warsaw
Ghetto, Jewish fighters rose up in arms
against their Nazi oppressors. We must
never forget the reality and meaning of
the Holocaust, or of the heroic resistance
against it.
On behalf of the American people, I
have committed myself and my admin-
istration to the cause of human rights.
That commitment will remain firm.
In Jewish homes all over the world-
in Israel, in Eastern and Western Europe,
in the Soviet Union, in Latin America,
and here in the United States-families
and friends will gather tonight for the
ceremony of the Seder. As they do, I greet
them and assure them that the love of
freedom they celebrate is shared by all
the people of the United States.
