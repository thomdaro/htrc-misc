Jan. 24
Administration of Jimmy Carter, 1978
DCI, which is the Director of Central In-
telligence, and also the Attorney General.
But in closing, let me remind the group
once again of what I said at the begin-
ning: One of the most professional and
competent organizations with which I
have ever dealt has been the Intelligence
Community. It consists of several thou-
sand highly professional, dedicated Amer-
ican people whose knowledge and expe-
rience stands as a bulwark in protecting
the security of our Nation.
And although there have been prob-
lems in the past, probably because of an
absence of a clear directive about de-
lineations of responsibility, I think that
this has quite often obscured the sacri-
ficial work that these good men and
women have done.
Again, I want to express my complete
appreciation and confidence in Admiral
Stan Turner, whose responsibilities under
this Executive order will be greatly mag-
nified. He's worked very closely with the
Attorney General and with the Secretary
of Defense. During normal peacetime,
which I hope will prevail throughout all
of our lifetime, he will have the respon-
sibilities that I outlined.
In case of a conflict or extreme national
emergency, under the Executive order,
the President has the authority to shift
part of that responsibility to the Secre-
tary of Defense to defend our Nation in
time of war. But that will be done in a
very careful, preplanned way. And the
present interrelationship that exists today,
to be enhanced by the Executive order,
between Defense, Justice, and intelli-
gence, is very clearly defined and is a
harmonious working relationship.
This could not have been possible
without a great deal of consultation and a
close cooperation and, I think, a mutual
purpose that was recognized by everyone.
I think this is a major step forward. I'm
very deeply grateful to all of you.
Thank you very much.
NOTE: The President spoke at 11:45 a.m. at
the signing ceremony in the Cabinet Room at
the White House.
