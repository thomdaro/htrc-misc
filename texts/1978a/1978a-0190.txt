Administration of Jimmy Carter, 1978
ship form will benefit substantially from
the rate cuts I have proposed for indi-
viduals.
But in addition to providing these gen-
eral tax incentives, I recommend three
proposals designed specifically to assist
small businesses. First, my tax program
will simplify and liberalize the rules (Sub-
chapter S) that treat certain small cor-
porations as partnerships; the number of
permissible shareholders will generally be
increased from 10 to 15, and the rules
governing subchapter S elections will be
made less stringent. Second, a simplified
method of depreciation will be authorized
for small businesses that will provide tax
benefits similar to the current ADR sys-
tem without complex recordkeeping re-
quirements. And third, risk-taking will be
encouraged by doubling the amount of a
small corporation's stock (from $500,000
to $1 million) that can qualify for special
ordinary loss treatment and by eliminat-
ing several technical requirements that
needlessly restrict the ability of small busi-
nesses to use this provision.
CONCLUSION
Enactment of these recommendations
will effect major reform of our tax laws,
provide significant tax relief, and sustain
our economic recovery.
This program will eliminate a number
of the inequities that undermine the integ-
rity of the tax system. It will make prep-
aration of returns simpler and more
understandable for millions of taxpayers.
Prompt passage will strengthen the con-
fidence of consumers and businesses in our
growing economy and lead to the creation
of up to one million new jobs for workers
who need them.
I look forward to working in partner-
ship with Congress to enact this program
of tax reform and tax reduction.
