Administration of Jimmy Carter, 1978
Jan. 20
and the difference was that I won. Thank
you very much.
I see one or two faces in the crowd who
were down in Plains in 1966 and 1970
when I began to run for Governor. And
I want to thank you in a special way and
let
you know that we're partners in every-
thing I do every day. And I want you to
stay close to me, because I need all the
help and all the advice, all the counsel,
all the criticism, all the prayers that I can
get.
You'd be amazed at how many times
we stand in a receiving line at the White
House or go down a crowd of people at
an airport or when I walked across the
front of this room tonight, and people
say, "We pray for you" or "Every month,
our church has a special prayer service for
you." And I say, "Look, make it every
week" [laughter]-"or every day be-
cause I really need it."
to be done. And I'm working and Jim-
my's working, but we always know that
you're here and that you care for us and
that you support us. I just want to say
that we need your continuing support, we
need your continuing prayers and we love
you all.
Thank you.
THE PRESIDENT. How many of you
think we have a great country? How
many of you are going to join with me
and Rosalynn and the rest of us to make
it even greater? [Applause]
Well, thank you again. The only thing
that I feel kind of strange about is me be-
ing way up here and you being way out
there. It's not the way I ran my campaign,
and that's the thing that I don't like about
it. But I love every one of you.
Thank you very much. God bless you
all.
NOTE: The President spoke at 8:07 p.m. in
Room 300 at the Georgia World Congress
Center.
I feel at ease with the job that I have.
I don't claim to know all the answers. I'm
not any better qualified than many of
you. But I sense that as President, as I
did 2 or 3 years ago, I still have you be- Atlanta, Georgia
hind me. And that makes the job easy
for me. Thank you very much.
I had another supporter, as you know,
way back then who traveled around the
country for me. Mother kept Amy. But
I want to let Rosalynn say just a word, if
you don't mind.

MRS. CARTER. I just want to thank
for all you've done for tonight to get
ready for this big banquet, for what
banquet, for what
you've done for us over the past year and
before that in the campaign. It means so
much to us. I know when we were cam-
paigning, we always were very confident
because we knew we had you at home and
we knew that no matter where we were in
the whole country, that you supported us.
We feel that same way.
Jimmy's doing, I think, a great job for
the country. There's so much that needs
Remarks at the Southern Salute to the
President Dinner. January 20, 1978
It's a wonderful thing in the South to
get almost as much applause as Bert
Lance, and I thank you for it. [Laughter]
It's really nice to be back down here at
home where I don't need an interpreter.
A lot of people say that I had a hard time
with an interpreter in Poland. But where
I really have a hard time is in Washing-
ton, trying to get my message out to the
people and explain what we're trying to
do with the Federal Government. It got
so bad this Christmas that when Amy and
I sent our letters to Santa Claus, I
got the dollhouse and she got a chain saw.
[Laughter]
I never have quite made the transition
from Plains to Washington successfully.
