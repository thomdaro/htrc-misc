Administration of Jimmy Carter, 1978
The group includes a boy and a girl
from each State, the District of Columbia,
Puerto Rico, Americans living abroad,
and 15 chosen at large.
The students were selected by the
Commission on Presidential Scholars in
the only nationwide program for honoring
academic excellence, leadership, other
evidence of superior attainment and, for
the first time this year, outstanding ability
in the arts.
This is the 15th anniversary of the
Presidential Scholars program, which was
established by Executive order of Presi-
dent Lyndon B. Johnson in 1964. The
Presidential Scholars receive no monetary
award, but they will be brought to Wash-
ington May 21 to 25 for a program dur-
ing which they will receive the 1978 Pres-
idential Scholars medallions. The visit
will include special interest seminars con-
ducted by authorities in many fields, ap-
pointments with their Senators and Rep-
resentatives, and forums, symposiums, and
other events scheduled at the State De-
partment, the Smithsonian Institution,
and other agencies.
