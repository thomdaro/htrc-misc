the comprehensive non-proliferation, export control, reprocessing evaluation and

review and approval and encouraging standardization of nuclear facility design.

My 1978 Budget which will soon be forwarded to the Congress will include

velopment in cooperation with private industry which is directed toward new
technologies for conserving energy and for producing energy from fossil,
nuclear, solar and geothermal sources.
