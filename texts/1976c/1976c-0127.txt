State of Connecticut and Lowell and Ron and Stu. Let me thank you for having
them at my side, and believe me, we sure need them back.
But this record of progress over the last 2 years will be the agenda for my ad-
ministration in the next 4 years. These are my goals. This is my pledgeâ€”to lead
this Nation forward on the path of peace, prosperity, and trust. Join me, if you
will, on the road to a great victory for the Republican Party and for the United
States of America in 1976.
Thank you very much.

3 million persons in 1977. The comprehensive reforms in the Medicare Improve-

of services, and a limit on Federal reimbursements for hospital and physician
services in order to help control health cost inflation. In total, my proposal would
