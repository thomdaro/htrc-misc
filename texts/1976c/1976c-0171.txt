FEDERAL CROP INSURANCE ACT
The Administration proposed a bill to amend the Federal Crop Insurance
Act and to repeal the disaster payment provisions for feed grains, cotton, and
wheat under the Agriculture Act of 1949. The proposed amendments would
permit the Federal Crop Insurance Corporation to offer insurance on a nation-
wide basis on feed grains, cotton, and wheat and thus provide the producers of
those commodities with protection from the financial losses attributable to crop
failures. It would also permit the Corporation to reinsure policies written by
private insurance companies thereby expanding the availability of this valuable
service. This program would save an estimated $250 million in government out-
lays annually and place the cost of and responsibility for maintaining crop in-
surance on the producers who would benefit from it.
RESTRUCTURE AGRICULTURE CONSERVATION PROGRAM
The Administration proposed a bill to update the conditions under which the
Federal Government provides financial assistance to agricultural producers for
needed soil, water, woodland, and wildlife conservation and environmental
enhancement measures on agricultural lands. Specifically, the bill would:
—provide for financial assistance to those agricultural producers who are
financially unable to fully carry out needed conservation practices; and,
—limit financial assistance under the Act to enduring type practices, pertain-
ing to soil, water, woodland, and wildlife conservation on agricultural
lands and emphasize long-term agreements as opposed to annual or short-
term conservation practices.
