Gerald R. Ford, 1976
fishery agreement between the United States and the German Democratic
Republic, signed at Washington on October 5, 1976.
This Agreement is significant because it is one of the first to be negotiated
in accordance with that legislation. I urge that the Congress give favorable
consideration to this Agreement at an early date. Since 60 calendar days of
continuous session as required by the legislation are not available before
March 1, 1977, I strongly recommend that the Congress consider issuance of a
joint resolution to bring this Agreement into force by that date.
The White House,

Message to the Congress Transmitting the United
States-Soviet Union International Fishery Agreement.
January 10, 1977
To the Congress of the United States:
In accordance with the Fishery Conservation and Management Act of 1976
(P.L. 94-265; 16 USC 1801), I transmit herewith a governing international
fishery agreement between the United States and the Union of Soviet Socialist
Republics, signed at Washington on November 26, 1976.
This Agreement is significant because it is one of a series to be negotiated in
accordance with that legislation. I urge that the Congress give favorable con-
sideration to this Agreement at an early date. Since 60 calendar days of con-
tinuous session as required by the legislation are not available before March 1,
1977, I strongly recommend that the Senate consider issuance of a joint resolu-
tion with the House of Representatives in order to bring this Agreement into
force by that date.
The White House,
January 10, 1977.
GERALD R. FORD
NOTE: The agreement is printed in Treaties and Other International Acts Series (TIAS 8528).
