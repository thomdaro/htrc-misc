Special Message to the Congress Reporting on Budget
Rescissions and Deferrals. November 5, 1976
To the Congress of the United States:
In accordance with the Impoundment Control Act of 1974, I am withdrawing
one previously proposed rescission and reporting three new deferrals. In addi-
tion, I am reporting revisions to two deferrals previously transmitted.
The withdrawal is for the highway crossing federal projects program of the
Federal Highway Administration. The three new deferrals, totaling $980.8
million affect programs of the Departments of Defense, Health, Education,
and Welfare, and the Treasury. The revised deferrals are for programs in the
Department of Health, Education, and Welfare and reflect routine increases in
the amounts previously deferred.
The details of the rescission withdrawal and each deferral are contained in
the attached reports.
The White House,
November 5, 1976.
GERALD R. FORD
NOTE: The attachments detailing the rescission and deferrals are printed in the Federal Register of Novem-
ber 5, 1976 (41 FR 49784).

Statement on the Death of Alexander Calder.
November 11, 1976
IT WAS with the deepest regret that I learned of the death of Alexander
Calder, whose universally recognized creativity in art brought joy to millions.
Mr. Calder's sculpture and innovative art forms helped evolve an entirely
new state of consciousness and demonstrated what American improvization
could achieve.
I am proud that a magnificent Calder is on display in my hometown, Grand
Rapids. It has won a place in the hearts of Michiganders, just as the Calder
artistry has enriched a world that became Calder's universe.
Art has lost a genius, and the United States has lost a great American who
contributed much to the civilization of the 20th century.
