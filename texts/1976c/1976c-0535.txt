Gerald R. Ford, 1976
Q. Mr. President, do you think that Mr. Carter responded to the first ques-
tion or went and made an opening statement?
THE PRESIDENT. Well, I thought he was very general, as I indicated. He
covered a great many issues without talking about any answers. Therefore, I
thought that he ought to be pinned down, and I thought the questioners
made a big effort to do so. And we certainly hopeâ€”or I certainly hope that
the American people will make certain in the future that he gives specific
answers to specific questions.
Q. Who won the debate?
THE PRESIDENT. I think we did all right. We enjoyed it.
Q. How do you think you did in comparison to Carter?
THE PRESIDENT. I am not the best one to pass judgment on that. I felt com-
fortable, I answered the questions specifically, and I feel very good about to-
night, just as I did about the first one. Thank you all very much.
REPORTER. Thank you, Mr. President.
NOTE: The exchange began at 8:05 p.m. at the Palace of Fine Arts Theatre.

Exchange With Reporters Following the Presidential
Campaign Debate in San Francisco.
October 6, 1976
REPORTER. Mr. President, could you tell us who you talked with since you came
home?
The President. I talked to my wonderful wife and to Secretary Kissinger.
Q. Well, what did they have to say to you?
The President. They all thought we did quite well.
Q. They think you won it?
THE PRESIDENT. Well, they are a little prejudiced, but I think they were opti-
mistic about the outcome of it.
Q. What did Secretary Kissinger have to say? Anything specific about how
the debate had gone with this subject?
THE PRESIDENT. He just felt that we had taken the offensive and we had
talked affirmatively about our successes. That was the truth, so he was very
pleased.
Q. Do you agree with Mrs. Ford and the Secretary that you won it?
