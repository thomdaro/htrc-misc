Public Papers of the Presidents
The last thirty budgets record a turbulent period in our history; wars, domes-
tic strife and serious economic problems. In the last two years, we have laid the
foundation for a positive future. We have stabilized international relationships
and created the framework for global progress. At home, we have restored con-
fidence in government while reversing the trends of inflation and unemploy-
ment. Building on this solid base, the policies and programs contained in this
budget can help us to fulfill the promise of America.

Message to the Congress Transmitting the United
States-Bulgaria International Fishery Agreement.
January 17, 1977
[Dated January 14, 1977. Released January 17, 1977]
To the Congress of the United States:
In accordance with The Fishery Conservation and Management Act of 1976
(P.L. 94â€“265; 16 USC 1801), I transmit herewith a governing international
fishery agreement between the United States and the People's Republic of Bul-
garia, signed at Washington on December 17, 1976.
This Agreement is significant because it is one of a series to be negotiated
in accordance with that legislation. I urge that the Congress give favorable
consideration to this Agreement at an early date. Since 60 calendar days of
continuous session as required by the legislation are not available before March
1, 1977, I strongly recommend that the Congress consider issuance of a joint
resolution in order to bring this Agreement into force by that date.
The White House,
January 14, 1977.
