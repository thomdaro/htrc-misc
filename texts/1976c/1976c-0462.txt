spending, would it send me a bill that is $4 billion over my $52.5 billion
request?
If the Congress really wanted to stop fraud and abuse in Federal programs like
Medicaid, would it appropriate more money this year than it did last year
without any reform?
If the Congress really wanted to end duplication and overlap in Federal
activities, would it continue all of these narrow programs this yearâ€”at higher
funding levels than last year?
If the Congress really wanted to cut the deficit and ease the burden on the
taxpayer, would it ignore serious reform proposals?
The resounding answer to all of these questions is no.
Our longtime ally, Great Britain, has now reached a critical point in its
illustrious history. The British people must now make some very painful de-
cisions on government spending. As Prime Minister Callaghan courageously
said just yesterday, "Britain for too long has lived on borrowed time, borrowed
money and borrowed ideas. We will fail if we think we can buy our way out
of our present difficulties by printing confetti money and by paying ourselves
more than we earn."
I cannot ask American taxpayers to accept unwarranted spending increases
without a commitment to serious reform. I do not believe the people want
more bureaucratic business as usual. I believe the people want the reforms I
have proposed which would target the dollars on those in real need while reduc-
ing Federal interference in our daily lives and returning more decision-making
freedom to State and local levels where it belongs.
I therefore return without my approval H.R. 14323 [14232], and urge the
Congress to enact immediately my budget proposals and to adopt my program
reforms.
