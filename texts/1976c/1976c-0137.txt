Gerald R. Ford, 1976
that the party is a minority party in American politics? And how do you win
an election that way?
THE PRESIDENT. Well, we are going to unite the Republican Party and appeal
to Independent voters and a number of Democrats, just as the Republicans did
in 1968 and 1972.
PARDON OF FORMER PRESIDENT NIXON
[23.] Q. Mr. President, in connection with the pardon, in both Senator
Mondale's speech and in Jimmy Carter's speech, there seemed to be a linkage
between the pardon and Watergate, itself. Do you see any such linkage, number
one, and secondly, do you think that Watergate should be an issue in this
campaign?
THE PRESIDENT. I granted the pardon because I thought it was in the national
interest. I think the American people will make the decision, not myself,
whether it will be an issue or not.
REPUBLICAN CONVENTION BALLOTING PROCEDURE
[24.] Q. Mr. President, do you expect a rules fight at the convention
that will allow some delegates to abstain on the first ballot and possibly the
second ballot?
THE PRESIDENT. Well, the Justice amendment, which we are proposing,
would require that all delegates vote according to the laws under which they
were selected. And I think that is a very proper amendment to carry out the
wishes of the people that supported those individuals at the time they were
chosen.
Q. Can I follow up, sir? Do you have an indication from the Reagan people
that they will not try and change the Justice amendment?
The President. To my knowledge, we have not consulted with them.
REPUBLICAN VICE-PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATE
[25.] Q. Mr. President, how many Vice-Presidential possibilities do you
have in mind?
THE PRESIDENT. Quite a few.
Q. Like maybe a half dozen, a dozen?
THE PRESIDENT. I am not going to get into the numbers game. We have a
fine, fine array of talent in the Republican Party and maybe elsewhere. And
so we will just keep that open until we make the final choice.
Q. [Inaudible].
