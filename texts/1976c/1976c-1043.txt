higher salaries in exchange for limitations upon other forms of income that give
rise to questions concerning ethics or conflicts of interest.
In order to demonstrate a firm commitment to the code of conduct reforms,
I urge each House of the Congress to take positive action—such as adoption of a
resolution—supporting the code within the thirty-day period available to reject
the proposed salary increases. I commend the leadership shown thus far by
both Houses in moving toward code of conduct reforms and I am confident that
the principles stated in the Commission's report will be adopted.

Special Message to the Congress Reporting on
Budget Rescissions and Deferrals. January 17, 1977
To the Congress of the United States:
In accordance with the Impoundment Control Act of 1974, I herewith propose
nine new rescissions totalling $1,001.3 million and report eight new deferrals
totalling $273.4 million in budget authority developed in connection with the
1978 budget. In addition, I am reporting $70.6 million in increases to five de-
ferrals previously transmitted.
The rescission proposals pertain to programs of the Departments of Com-
merce, Defense, State, and Transportation as well as the Small Business Admin-
istration and an International Security Assistance program.
The new deferrals involve programs of the Department of Commerce and
Transportation and the Energy Research and Development Administration
while the increases to existing deferrals relate to the Departments of Agricul-
ture, Defense, and Transportation.
I urge the Congress to act favorably on the rescission proposals.
The White House,
