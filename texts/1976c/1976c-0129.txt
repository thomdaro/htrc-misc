promptly on this legislation.
I will be glad to answer any questions.

QUESTIONS
PRESIDENT FORD'S DELEGATE SUPPORT
[2.] Q. Mr. President, do you think that you have the Presidential nomina-
tion now locked up, and if not, do you think you will have it by the end of
the week?
THE PRESIDENT. I am very encouraged with the results over the weekend. I
believe that we are getting very close right now to the magic number of 1,130.
I am confident by the time we get to Kansas City, we will have 1,130-plus.
Q. How many delegates do you think you have now?
THE PRESIDENT. The best estimate, I think, is 1,103, and we expect some
more good news this week. Therefore, by the time we get to Kansas City, I am
confident we will have over 1,130.
PROSPECTS FOR DEFEATING JIMMY CARTER
[3.] Q. Mr. President, is Governor Carter beatable?
THE PRESIDENT. Absolutely.
Q. And if so, how?
THE PRESIDENT. By the kind of an affirmative program that we have developed
in the last 23 months here in the White House under the Ford administration.
I intend to have an affirmative campaign based on the results of turning the
economy around, achieving the peace, and the restoration of public trust in
the White House itself.
PRESIDENT FORD'S FOREIGN POLICY RECORD
[4.] Q. Mr. President, Jimmy Carter has set forth some of his beliefs
on foreign policy. Can you tell us whether you think there are major differences
with what you are doing now in foreign policy, and what are they?
THE PRESIDENT. Since I strongly believe that our foreign policy has been
a successful one—we have achieved the peace, we have the military capability
and the diplomatic skill to maintain that peace—I don't see, from what I have
read, any legitimate complaints or objections by any of my Democratic friends,
