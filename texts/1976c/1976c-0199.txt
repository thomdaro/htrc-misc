lian people on the occasion of the American Bicentenary. The Australian Gov-
ernment was participating in a range of activities to celebrate the occasion. The
Prime Minister said he was looking forward to his visit to Harvard University
to inaugurate the Chair of Australian studies. He expressed the hope that this
Chair would be used to advance understanding not merely between the United
States and Australia but between both countries and other nations with different
history, traditions and culture.
The President and the Prime Minister considered that their discussions had
shown a very close similarity of view on a wide range of important international
and bilateral matters and had further strengthened ties between Australia and
the United States. The Prime Minister thanked the President and Mrs. Ford for
the warmth of the welcome and the hospitality extended to him and to Mrs.
Fraser and to members of his party.

Special Message to the Congress Reporting on a
Budget Rescission. July 29, 1976
To the Congress of the United States:
In accordance with the Impoundment Control Act of 1974, I herewith propose
rescission of $45 million in budget authority appropriated for payment to the
Legal Services Corporation.
Approval of this rescission proposal will reduce Federal spending by $45 mil-
lion over 1977 and 1978. The proposed rescission would prevent unneeded ex-
pansion of Legal Services Corporation activities and delay greater geographic
coverage until program evaluations are completed.
The details of the proposed rescission are contained in the attached report.
GERALD R. FORD
The White House,
July 29, 1976.
NOTE: The attachment detailing the rescission is printed in the Federal Register of August 3, 1976 (41
FR 32570).
