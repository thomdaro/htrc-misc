Public Papers of the Presidents
It took a lot of time, a lot of effort, but the net result is good for the Republican
Party.
Q. Governor Reagan, are you saying you will permit your name to be en-
tered for the Vice-Presidential nomination tomorrow night?
GOVERNOR REAGAN. No.
Q. You will not permit it?
GOVERNOR REAGAN. No.
Q. Mr. President, could you reflect a little on the course of the campaign, and
