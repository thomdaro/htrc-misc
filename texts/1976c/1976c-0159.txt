quency programs at the 1972 level, and place special emphasis on improving
the operation of State and local court systems. This legislation is designed to
continue a vital Federal financial and technical assistance program to State
and local governments so that they can improve their ability to enforce the law.
JUSTICE DEPARTMENT REORGANIZATION AND REFORM ACT
The proposed legislation would provide a constitutional means of helping

Section in the Criminal Division to investigate and prosecute job-related crim-

annual financial statements.
