the scheme of things. The family circle suggests a oneness similar to that of the
church family in that which we strive to achieve in the human family.
I remember a poem that my mother taught me as a young boy, by the great
American poet Edwin Markham, which beautifully expresses the determina-
tion that we must move beyond tolerance to love. It goes like this:
"He drew a circle that shut me out-
Heretic, rebel, a thing to flout.
But Love and I had the wit to win:
We drew a circle that took him in."
I am moved that you have brought me in, within this great circle today, and
by the spirit of love and service that animates it. I hope that we all, whatever
our country or creed, will continue to draw larger and larger circles until that
day in His good time when all God's people are one.
As we work together for a better world where our brothers and sisters are free
from hunger and fear, let us keep our hearts free from pride and hate in the spirit
of this old familiar prayer of the good St. Francis:
"Lord, make me an instrument of Thy [Your] peace.
Where there is hatred let me sow love;
Where there is injury, pardon;
Where there is doubt, faith;
Where there is despair, hope;
Where there is darkness, light;
Where there is sadness, joy."
God bless, and may you have a safe journey to your homes.
Thank you.
NOTE: The President spoke at 4:43 p.m. at John
