Message to the Congress Transmitting Reports on the Military
Incentive Awards Program for 1975. January 13, 1977
To the Congress of the United States:
Forwarded herewith in accordance with the provisions of 10 U.S.C. 1124
are reports of the Secretary of Defense and the Secretary of Transportation on
awards made during Fiscal Year 1975 to members of the Armed Forces for
suggestions, inventions and scientific achievements.
Participation by military personnel in the cash awards program was author-
ized by the Congress in 1965. More than 1.76 million suggestion submissions
since that time attest to the success which the program has had as a means
of motivating military personnel to seek ways of reducing costs and improving
efficiency. Of those suggestions submitted, more than 275,000 have been adopted
with resultant tangible first-year benefits in excess of $873,000,000.
Of the 125,777 suggestions which were submitted by military personnel (in-
cluding Coast Guard military personnel) during Fiscal Year 1975, 20,760 were
adopted. Cash awards totaling $1,442,536 were paid for these adopted sugges-
tions, based not only on the tangible first-year benefits of $74,347,607.94 which
were realized therefrom, but also on many additional benefits and improve-
ments of an intangible nature. Enlisted personnel received $1,175,908.50 in
awards, which represents 81 percent of the total cash awards paid. The remain-
ing 19 percent was received by officer personnel and amounted to $266,627.50.
Attached are reports of the Secretary of the Defense and the Secretary of
Transportation containing statistical information on the military awards pro-
gram and brief descriptions of some of the more noteworthy contributions made
by military personnel during Fiscal Year 1975.
