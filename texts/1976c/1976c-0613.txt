Remarks in Union, New Jersey.
October 13, 1976
THANK YOU all very, very much. These wonderful bands, I thank each and
every one of you. Thank you very much.
It's great to be in Union. I saw a sign on the way here, a sign that means a
great deal to me. The sign said, â€œJersey Likes Jerry." Let me respond by saying
Jerry likes Jersey. You're great.
I like Jersey because I know good people like Cliff Case, like Bob Kean, who
I had the honor of serving with for a number of years. I like the kind of people
that you have joined with me in my campaign. And I am in New Jersey because
New Jersey is a very important State.
I have heard rumors, I hear talk, I read some stuff that's written that the
American people are apathetic, they're not going to vote, they don't care about
this election. Let me say very strongly, I believe the American people do care.
You care because there is a clear difference between Mr. Carter and myself. He
wants to increase your taxes. I want to reduce and decrease your taxes.
Mr. Carter wants to increase Federal spending. I want to hold the lid on Fed-
eral spending. Mr. Carter wants to undercut our national defense. I think that's
wrong. America has to stay number one, and we will under President Ford.
So, when you come right down to it, there is a choice. The American people are
concerned, they do care. And I say again, Jerry Ford loves Jersey just like Jersey
loves Jerry.
Thank you very much.
NOTE: The President spoke at 5:05 p.m. at the
Town and Campus Inn. In his remarks, he re-
ferred to Senator Clifford P. Case and Representa-
tive Robert W. Kean 1939-59 of New Jersey.
