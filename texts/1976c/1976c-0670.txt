ing wholesomeness to those consumers who demand such protection for this
specialty food and are willing to pay for the protection, I do not believe that a
mandatory program is wise public policy.
In addition, it is estimated that the cost to the taxpayer of government
inspection provided by this Act could be more than 10 cents per pound.
The limited benefit to be derived by a relative few consumers of rabbit meat
cannot be justified in terms of the cost to the taxpayer. I am therefore not
approving H.R. 10073.

Statement on Signing the Bill Exempting the Delta Queen
From Certain Safety Laws. October 18, 1976
I HAVE signed H.R. 13326, which will extend until November 1, 1983, the
existing exemption of the steamboat Delta Queen from the requirements of
Public Law 89-777, regarding safety laws applicable to ships. This exemption is
needed to permit the Delta Queen to operate on overnight cruises after
November 1, 1978.
The Delta Queen, a historic paddle wheel riverboat, was built in 1928 and
has been operating on the Ohio and Mississippi Rivers since that time. It was
entered on the National Register of historic vessels in 1970. Its preservation as
a symbol of Americana is important to the people of this Nation to whom our
national heritage means so much. This legislation will preserve a splendid
reminder of America's past.
NOTE: As enacted, H.R. 13326, approved October 17, 1976, is Public Law 94-535 (90 Stat. 2496).

every 10 years.
