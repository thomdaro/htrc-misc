Memorandum of Disapproval of the Senate Foreign
Sovereign Immunities Bill. October 22, 1976
[Dated October 21, 1976. Released October 22, 1976]
I AM withholding my approval from S. 3553, the Foreign Sovereign Immuni-
ties Act of 1976, for technical reasons.
In its haste to adjourn, the Congress passed identical Senate and House bills
on this subject. At the time the Senate passed the House bill, H.R. 11315, it at-
tempted to vacate its earlier passage of S. 3553 but was unable to do so because
it had left the Senate's jurisdiction. The House, unaware that the Senate had
passed the House bill, also passed the Senate bill.
In view of the Senate's action in attempting to vacate its passage of S. 3553,
there is doubt that S. 3553 has been properly enrolled, and therefore I am sepa-
rately approving H.R. 11315 and must withhold my approval from S. 3553.

It has often been said that the development of an international legal order
