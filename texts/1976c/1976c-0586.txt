Public Papers of the Presidents
Dr. Olson was a civilian biochemist employed by the Department of the
Army. He died when he jumped from a 10th floor window of a hotel in New
York City on November 28, 1953. Approximately 1 week earlier, employees
of the CIA had administered LSD to Dr. Olson. The administration of the
drug occurred without his prior knowledge and would appear to have been a
proximate cause of his death.
Legislation to appropriate $1,250,000 to compensate the wife and three chil-
dren of Dr. Olson for his death was supported by this administration. However,
the Congress approved a measure calling for the payment of a total of $750,000
to these survivors. Should the Congress next year consider further private relief
legislation to raise the total amount of compensation to $1.25 million, this
administration would support the measure.
The approval of this bill underscores the basic principle that an individual
citizen of this Nation should be protected from unreasonable transgressions
into his personal activities. There should be no doubt that my administration
is opposed to the use of drugs, chemicals, or other substances without the prior
knowledge and consent of the individual affected. At the request of the family
of Dr. Olson, I take this opportunity to highlight this continuing policy.
NOTE: As enacted, S. 3035, approved October 12, 1976, is Private Law 94-126.

Memorandum of Disapproval of the Bill Providing for the
Relief of Camilla A. Hester. October 12, 1976
I HAVE withheld my approval from S. 3790, a private bill which would author-
ize a civil service survivor annuity retroactive to September 28, 1972, to Mrs.
Camilla A. Hester as the widow of the late John A. Hester.
While I am sympathetic to Mrs. Hester's circumstances, S. 3790 unfortunately
contains two precedent-setting provisions which I consider very undesirable,
not only for future private relief legislation, but also for ordinary claims under
the Civil Service Retirement System.
The first would require the Civil Service Commission to pay interest at 6
percent per annum retroactive to 1972 on the survivor's benefit which would be
authorized by S. 3790. The second would require the Treasury to pay Mrs.
Hester $5,000 as compensation for her successful effort to be awarded the
benefit. Neither of these provisions are appropriate, in my judgment, in bringing
Mrs. Hester equitable relief.
