Public Papers of the Presidents
JAMES D. WATSON
"Scholar, teacher, author and scientific pioneer, James D. Watson has
challenged the mysteries of life itself and charted a new path in mankind's end-
less search for truth. His intellectual courage and relentless pursuit of scientific
knowledge have earned him the respect and admiration of his country and a
permanent place as one of the great explorers of the 20th century.‚Äù
ARTHUR FIEDLER
"Violinist, conductor and musical innovator, Maestro Fiedler has bridged
the gap between popular and classical music and given millions around the
world a greater appreciation of America's rich cultural heritage. His spirit
and zest for living have made an immeasurable contribution to the quality of
American life."
Mr. President, that concludes the presentations. Lowell Thomas, who is on
his way, has been delayed because of inclement weather.
THE PRESIDENT. We all regret that Lowell Thomas, because of inclement
weather, couldn't make it. He is on his way and, hopefully, he will arrive before
the luncheon is over.
But let me again congratulate each and every one of you. I regret that Irving
Berlin, Alexander Calder, the late Alexander Calder, and Georgia O'Keeffe
were unable to be represented here today. We will of course present their
medals to them or to their families at a later date.
In closing, let me voice our country's deep gratitude and great appreciation,
not only to you but to all those who helped you achieve what you accomplished.
Each of you has friends, coworkers, teammates, families who share in your
achievements and in our pride today.
Again, congratulations and very best wishes.
Now, Betty and I will join the honorees in the Grand Hall so that the other
guests may meet them and after which, we want you all to join us in the State
Dining Room.
Thank you very much.
NOTE: The President spoke at 12:20 p.m. at a ceremony in the East Room at the White House.
