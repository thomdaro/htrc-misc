Social Security trust funds—which are now expected to pay out about $4 billion
more in benefits each year than they take in.
The "Social Security Benefit Indexing Act" would correct a serious flaw in
the method of computing benefits which, if left unchanged, would create
severe long-range financial pressures on the trust funds. The two measures are
necessary first steps to solve both the short and long-range financial problems of
the Social Security system.
CATASTROPHIC HEALTH PROTECTION
MEDICARE IMPROVEMENTS OF 1976
The proposed "Medicare Improvements of 1976” is designed to provide greater
protection against catastrophic health costs for the 25 million aged and disabled
Americans eligible for Medicare. An estimated 3 million beneficiaries would
pay less in 1977 as a result of the proposed annual limits of $500 for hospital
services and $250 for physician services. The legislation would also provide for
moderate cost-sharing for Medicare beneficiaries to encourage economical use
of medical services and would slow down health cost inflation by putting a
limit on Federal payments to hospitals and physicians.
BUSING
SCHOOL DESEGREGATION STANDARDS AND ASSISTANCE ACT
The purpose of this legislation is to maintain progress toward the orderly
elimination of illegal segregation in public schools while preserving community
control of schools. The legislation would set guidelines for Federal courts con-
cerning the use of busing in school desegregation cases. It would require that
courts determine the extent to which acts of unlawful discrimination have
caused a greater degree of racial concentration in a school or school system
than would have existed otherwise and to confine the relief provided to correct-
ing the racial imbalance caused by those unlawful acts. The legislation would
also limit the duration of court-ordered busing, generally to a period of no
longer than five years.
