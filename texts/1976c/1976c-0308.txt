Statement on Signing the Bill To Extend the Period
Prohibiting Revision of the District of Columbia Criminal
Code. September 7, 1976
TODAY I have signed H.R. 12261, a bill "To extend the period during which
the Council of the District of Columbia is prohibited from revising the criminal
laws of the District."
The prohibition on the Council's changing the Criminal Code is necessary be-
cause completion of the study for the comprehensive revision and recodifica-
tion of the Criminal Code by the D.C. Law Revision Commission is a pre-
requisite to the transfer of jurisdiction to the Council over the D.C. Criminal
Code.
The bill gives the Commission additional time within which to make recom-
mendations to the Congress for the comprehensive revision of the District of
Columbia Criminal Code. The Commission has begun the task of reviewing the
criminal laws of the District but will not be able to complete its work by Janu-
ary 3, 1977, when, without this legislation, the D.C. Council would have been able
to amend the District of Columbia Criminal Code.
No major revision of the District's criminal laws should be undertaken
without the benefit of the Commission's recommendations.
NOTE: As enacted, H.R. 12261, approved September 7, 1976, is Public Law 94-402 (90 Stat. 1220).

Remarks on Administration Efforts To Account for Americans
Missing in Action in Vietnam. September 7, 1976
AT MY direction the American Embassy in Paris today contacted North Viet-
namese representatives and informed them that we expect that the United
States will be provided with a full accounting without further delay of all
Americans missing in action in Vietnam.
Speaking on behalf of all Americans, I welcome the fact that the Vietnamese
have finally begun to keep their promise to provide information on our men
missing in action in Southeast Asia.
While the report on these 12 men was grim, it at least resolved their status
