Gerald R. Ford, 1976
Give me your mandate, and we will create a tax structure that is fair to all,
that will preserve the family home, the family business, the family farm, that
will give us business tax incentives to build new plants, to modernize old ones,
and to create more jobs.
Give me your mandate, and I will lead this Nation on a path of peace through
strength, and we will live in peace and freedom in the United States of
America.
I have no fear for the future of this country. For America, the future is a
friend. And as we go forward together, I promise you once more—as I promised
you before—to uphold the Constitution, to do what is right as God gives me
to see the right, and to do the very best that I can for our beloved America. God
helping me, I will not let you down.
Thank you and good night.
NOTE: The President spoke at 8:17 p.m. at the

October 24, 1976
REPORTER. How do you feel about your San Diego reception?
The President. I think that the reception here tonight is one of the finest, if
not the best. And I want to thank everybody tonight that is here-35,000 to 40,-
000 people on a Sunday night, and the warmth and the friendliness and the
enthusiasm—well, I will sleep better. It convinces me we are going to carry
California.
Q. How do you feel about the race now?
THE PRESIDENT. I think we will surprise some people. I am confident. I think
we will come out on top on November 2.
Q. What do you intend to emphasize in this final week of blitz?
THE PRESIDENT. Trust, peace, and prosperity.
Thank you
you all very, very much.
