Public Papers of the Presidents
-expanded geological and geophysical research programs which broaden our
knowledge of the earth's evolutionary process and provide information of
practical importance;
—continued development of the capability to mine deep seabed minerals
without damage to the environment;
-enhanced opportunities for ocean-related recreational activities;
-strengthened our ability to forecast marine environmental conditions; and;
-began formal negotiations with other nations in the UN Law of the Sea
Conference during a two-month session in Caracas, Venezuela.
The report which I am transmitting emphasizes these achievements and pro-
vides additional information on the Federal Ocean Program budget for fiscal
years 1974-1976, as well as on the National Sea Grant Program and the status
of the federally supported marine research fleet.
Subsequent to the period covered by this report, there have been several devel-
opments of importance to Federal Ocean Policy including:
-the completion of three additional substantive negotiating sessions of the
UN Law of the Sea Conference;
—the enactment of the Fishery Conservation and Management Act in April
1976 which, effective March 1, 1977, will extend our fisheries jurisdiction to
200 miles;
-the leasing of Outer Continental Shelf areas for oil and gas exploitation; and
—a budgetary increase for the Federal Ocean Program from $872.5 million in
FY 1976 to $956.6 million in FY 1977.
As indicated in the report, the Federal Ocean Program was designed to ad-
vance and facilitate this nation's expanding uses of the sea and its resources. As
a major oceans user the United States will continue to pursue forward-looking
programs, aware of the need to safeguard the quality of the marine environment
and conscious of the need to cooperate with other nations on programs and
policies that will advance our interests and those of the world community.
