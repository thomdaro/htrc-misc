Special Message to the Congress Reporting on a Budget
Rescission. September 7, 1976
To the Congress of the United States:
In accordance with the Impoundment Control Act of 1974, I herewith pro-
pose rescission of $126,750,000 in budget authority available in the transition
quarter for the Foreign military credit sales program. Approval of this rescis-
sion proposal would reduce Federal spending by $83 million through 1979.
Unusual circumstances not provided for by the Impoundment Control Act
of 1974 have brought about the transmission of this special message at a time
that will not allow for a 45-day period of continuous session of the Congress
prior to the end of the transition period when the affected funds lapse. These
circumstances result from the coincidence of (1) the late approval of the For-
eign Assistance Appropriations Act, 1976, on June 30, 1976, the eve of the tran-
sition quarter, (2) the short duration of the unique transition quarter itself,
and (3) the schedule of congressional recesses of more than three days during
this period. In view of this unusual situation, I ask the Congress to give prompt
consideration to the proposed rescission.
The details of the proposed rescission are contained in the attached report.

The White House,
September 7, 1976.
NOTE: The attachment detailing the rescission is printed in the Federal Register of September 10, 1976 (41
