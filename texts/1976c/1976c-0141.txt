Gerald R. Ford, 1976
MEETING WITH THE NEW JERSEY DELEGATES
[35.] Q. Mr. President, all 67 members of the New Jersey delegation are al-
ready in your column.
THE PRESIDENT. I hope.
Q. Why are you bringing them down here this afternoon to a private meet-
ing from which the press has been barred ?
THE PRESIDENT. I am inviting them down because I want to meet them per-
sonally, just as I said a few moments ago. I would like very much to have the
opportunity of meeting all of the delegates and alternates to the national con-
vention, and this is a good way for me to do with the New Jersey delegation as
I have with the other delegations.
Q. What will be the nature of this meeting, and do you have any thoughts
about the exclusion of the press from-
THE PRESIDENT. I didn't know until a few moments ago that members of the
press were excluded.
Q. Do you want to revoke it? [Laughter]
THE PRESIDENT. We have had a numer of such meetings, and the question
never came up from the press before, and I just don't see why we should make
an exception here.
PRESIDENT FORD'S RATING IN PUBLIC OPINION POLLS
[36.] Q. Mr. President, why are you down so far in the polls when you
are pitted against Jimmy Carter?
The President. The only poll that really counts is the one that is going to
come on November 2 when the voters of this country decide in all 50 States. And
I will rely on that one.
Q. But how can you account for the preferences there?
THE PRESIDENT. I don't think we should analyze the ups and downs of periodic
public opinion polls. The real one that counts—and that is the one that is going
to decide this great election—is the one that comes November 2.
NOTE: President Ford's thirty-fifth news conference began at 1:30 p.m. on the North Lawn at the White
House.
