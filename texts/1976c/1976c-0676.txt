Statement on Signing the Bill Designating Acreage of
Point Reyes National Seashore as Part of the National
Wilderness System. October 19, 1976
FOR MILLIONS of Americans in California and stretching far beyond,
Point Reyes represents a wonderful haven where one can rest at peace with the
land and the sea. I take great pleasure in signing special legislation that desig-
nates over 25,000 acres of Point Reyes National Seashore as part of the Nation's
Wilderness System. By officially becoming part of the Wilderness System, Point
Reyes will be preserved in its natural beauty not only for this generation but for
many generations to come.
NOTE: As enacted, the bill (H.R. 8002), approved October 18, 1976, is Public Law 94-544 (90 Stat. 2515).

Statement on Signing the Bill Designating Eugene O'Neill's
Home and Property as a National Historic Site.
October 19, 1976
ONE OF the finest tributes that a country can pay to its giants in art and litera-
ture is to erect living memorials to their names.
Eugene O'Neill will always be a giant of American literature, so I take special
pleasure in signing legislation establishing his home and property near Oakland,
California, as a national historic site and as a home for the performing arts.
Eugene O'Neill was dedicated to the theater. This park will remind Ameri-
cans for years to come not only of his contributions but those of many other
artists who have added immeasurably to the wisdom and pleasure of all
mankind.
NOTE: As enacted, the bill (S. 2398), approved October 18, 1976, is Public Law 94-539 (90 Stat. 2501).
