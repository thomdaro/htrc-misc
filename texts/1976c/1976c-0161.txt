GENERAL REVENUE SHARING AND BLOCK GRANTS
â€¢
GENERAL REVENUE SHARING: EXTENSION AND REVISION OF THE STATE AND
LOCAL FISCAL ASSISTANCE ACT
This proposal would extend and revise the highly successful general revenue
sharing program which expires on December 31, 1976. The program would be
extended for five and three-quarters years, and the current method of funding
with annual increases of $150 million would be retained. The basic revenue
sharing formula would be retained but the existing per capita restraint would
be eased. Civil rights and public participation provisions would be strengthened
while reporting requirements would be made more flexible.
FEDERAL ASSISTANCE FOR COMMUNITY SERVICES ACT
This proposal would improve and strengthen the program of social services
established under Title XX of the Social Security Act. The $2.5 billion provided
annually by the Federal Government would be distributed as a block grant to
the States, with no requirement for State matching funds. Most Federal re-
quirements and prohibitions on the use of Federal funds would be eliminated.
Services to low-income Americans would be emphasized; Federal funds would
be focused on those whose incomes fall below the poverty income guidelines.
FINANCIAL ASSISTANCE FOR ELEMENTARY AND SECONDARY EDUCATION
This proposal would consolidate 24 programs of Federal assistance to State
and local education agencies for non-postsecondary education purposes into one
block grant. Three-quarters of the Federal support would have to be used for
disadvantaged and handicapped students, with greater flexibility for States
to target funds among programs in accordance with their own priorities. Ad-
ministrative requirements on the States would be greatly reduced through
reduction of Federal regulations and simplification of reporting procedures, and
public participation would be required in the State planning process.
FINANCIAL ASSISTANCE FOR HEALTH CARE ACT
This proposal would consolidate Medicaid and 15 categorical Federal health
programs into a single $10 billion block grant to the States. The proposal is
designed to overcome some of the most serious defects in the present system of
Federal financing of health care and to permit States to meet their citizens'
