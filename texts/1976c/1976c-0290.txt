Message to the Congress Transmitting Annual Report of
the National Endowment for the Arts and the National
Council on the Arts. August 31, 1976
To the Congress of the United States:
I hereby transmit to the Congress the Annual Report of the National Council
on the Arts and the National Endowment for the Arts for Fiscal Year 1975.
Our Bicentennial year marks the beginning of a second decade for the Arts
Endowment which, under the guidance of the National Council, has made a
substantial contribution to enriching the quality of life in America. This is a
time for us to reflect upon our history and to reassess our goals for the future.
The arts have always been an expression of the diversity of America's richly
varied cultural experience. We are beginning to appreciate how important the
arts are as resources to improve our cities-to bring creativity into our schools-
to bring greater perception to all, young and old.
This Annual Report reflects the Federal government's continuing support for
the arts and its concern that public funds be instrumental in generating private
dollars. The efforts of the Arts Endowment in that regard are very gratifying
and I hope that each member of Congress will share my enthusiasm for this
agency's achievements.
The White House,
August 31, 1976.

I AM sending to the Congress today the Bicentennial Land Heritage Act. This

recreation areas, and wildlife sanctuaries. It will provide funds for the develop-
ment of these new lands to make them accessible and enjoyable.
