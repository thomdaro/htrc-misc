Statement on Signing the Arts, Humanities, and Cultural
Affairs Act of 1976. October 10, 1976
I AM pleased today to sign H.R. 12838 authorizing the National Foundation
on the Arts and Humanities to continue and expand its work through 1980. The
Arts, Humanities, and Cultural Affairs Act of 1976 reflects the continuing strong
bipartisan support of the programs of the National Endowments for the Arts
and for the Humanities.
I have supported the Foundation continuously, both as a Congressman and
since I became President. The support of the arts and humanities provided by
the Federal Government has permitted a marked increase in individual par-
ticipation in, and support of, a wide range of cultural activities.
In striving to make America's third century the century of the individual,
the Foundation should play a leadership role in improving the quality of life
throughout the Nation. I take great pride in signing this legislation in reaffirma-
tion of that strong commitment of my administration.
NOTE: As enacted, H.R. 12838, approved October 8, 1976, is Public Law 94-462 (90 Stat. 1971).

Statement on Signing the International Terrorism
Prevention Bill.
October 10, 1976
WITHIN the last few months, we have witnessed a new outbreak of interna-
tional terrorism, some of which has been directed against persons who carry the
important burdens of diplomacy. Last summer, we were grieved by the brutal
murders of our Ambassador to Lebanon and his Economic Counsellor. We also
have seen a series of acts of violence directed against diplomatic missions in the
United States for which we have host-country responsibilities. These acts can-
not and will not be tolerated in the United States, nor should they be tolerated
anywhere in the world. Preventing or punishing such acts is a prime concern of
this Government and one which I will pursue with all the force of this office.
