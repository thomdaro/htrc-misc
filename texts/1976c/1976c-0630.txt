Public Papers of the Presidents
THE PRESIDENT. I repeat that the Internal Revenue Service, the FBI, the Joint
Committee on Taxation, two committees in the House and in the Senate, and an
overwhelming majority of the Members of the House and Senate believe the

Thank you all. Thank you very much.
MS. LEWINE. Thank you.
NOTE: President Ford's thirty-eighth news confer-

Building. It was broadcast live on radio and tele-

by men and women everywhere in the country who have come to appreciate, as
I have, what the arts can mean in their individual lives and the lives of their
communities. Accepting responsibility for this public interest, they have encour-
aged and shared, with leadership and dollars, in grassroots efforts to advance
our cultural legacy, foster artistic creativity, and make the arts more readily avail-
able to all. We can take pride in this record, and we must work together to
extend it.
In the past 10 years the Federal Government has provided leadership and fund-
ing, serving as a catalyst in this American renaissance. Today there are many
Federal and quasi-Federal programs which can assist artists, dancers, photog-
