Gerald R. Ford, 1976
evening that the news from the doctors in Pennsylvania had led to another
slowdown in the Congress.
I am frankly very dumfounded to know that the Congress, which took the
time and effort to enact illadvised legislation to exempt its own Members from
certain State income taxes, has failed to act to protect 215 million Americans
from the threat of swine flu. Drug manufacturers have produced over 100 mil-
lion doses of swine flu vaccine in bulk form, but that vaccine has not been pre-
pared in suitable dosage form, pending action by the Congress.
Because of these legislative delays, we are, at this very moment, at least 6 weeks
away from beginning an effective inoculation program. Had Congress acted
promptly after I submitted my proposal, we would have been in a position to
dispatch the shipments of vaccine today.
Further delay in this urgently needed legislation is unconscionable. I call on
the Congress to act now-before its next recessâ€”so that the health of the Ameri-
can people will be fully protected.
NOTE: The President spoke at 3:38 p.m. in the Briefing Room at the White House.

Statement on Senate Action Rejecting an Income Tax
Exemption Proposal. August 6, 1976
THE CONGRESS has been working on tax reform for over 3 years. The Sen-
ate is presently considering a 1,600-page document filled with hundreds of pro-
visions and scores of amendments, some of which are good, but many of which
would benefit special interests.
This afternoon the Senate tabled a simple, straightforward proposal, offered
by Senator Dole, to raise the personal income tax exemption from $750 to $1,000
a year. The vote was 57-29.
This proposed amendment would reduce the total tax liabilities of Americans
by $10.2 billion annually. This represents a tax saving of $193 a year for a family
of four earning $14,000.
I regret that the Senate has rejected this amendment which would benefit all
taxpayers and would promote real equity in the tax system.
