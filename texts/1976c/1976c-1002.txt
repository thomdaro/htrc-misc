Message to the Congress Transmitting the United
States-Romania International Fishery Agreement.
January 10, 1977
To the Congress of the United States:
In accordance with the Fishery Conservation and Management Act of 1976
(P.L. 94–265; 16 USC 1801), I transmit herewith a governing international
fishery agreement between the United States and the Socialist Republic of Ro-
mania, signed at Bucharest on November 23, 1976.
This Agreement is significant because it is one of a series to be negotiated in
accordance with that legislation. I urge that the Congress give favorable con-
sideration to this Agreement at an early date. Since 60 calendar days of con-
tinuous session as required by the legislation are not available before March 1,
1977, I strongly recommend that the Senate consider issuance of a joint resolu-
tion with the House of Representatives in order to bring this Agreement into
force by that date.
