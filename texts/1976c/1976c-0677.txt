Statement on Signing the Bill Designating Forest Acreage
of the Congaree Swamp as a National Monument.
October 19, 1976
EARLY IN its history the southeastern United States was covered with forests,
but the remarkable industrial progress in that area along with many logging
operations has now changed much of the landscape. The greatest remaining con-
centration of virgin hardwood forests in riverbottom land is now the Congaree
Swamp, not far away from Columbia, South Carolina.
I am pleased to sign into law special legislation that will designate 15,000
acres of the hardwood forest in Congaree Swamp as a national monument. By
officially coming within the National Park System, this forest and its unique
ecological system will be preserved not just for this generation but for many gen-
erations to come.
NOTE: As enacted, the bill (H.R. 11891), approved October 18, 1976, is Public Law 94-545 (90 Stat. 2517).

Statement on Signing the Bill Expanding the Indiana Dunes
National Seashore. October 19, 1976
SINCE ITS establishment almost a decade ago, the Indiana Dunes National Sea-
shore has provided a wide range of recreational opportunities for people and an
excellent habitat for plants and wildlife along the southeastern shore of Lake
Michigan.
Yet, the Indiana Dunes has also been a point of controversy, because many
people recognized that in preserving the unique qualities of the area, many
lands nearby also needed protection.
I am pleased to sign into law special legislation that will expand the acreage
of Indiana Dunes by over one-third. This is a welcome step in our efforts to
increase the recreational opportunities and improve the quality of life for the
American people.
NOTE: As enacted, the bill (H.R. 11455), approved October 18, 1976, is Public Law 94-549 (90 Stat. 2529).
