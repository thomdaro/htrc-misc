Message to the Congress Transmitting Annual Report of
the Federal Prevailing Rate Advisory Committee.
September 2, 1976
[Dated September 1, 1976. Released September 2, 1976]
To the Congress of the United States:
In accordance with section 5347 (e) of title 5 of the United States Code, I hereby
transmit to you the 1975 Annual Report of the Federal Prevailing Rate Advisory
Committee.
In March of this year, I sent to the Congress a legislative proposal to reform
procedures for setting pay under the prevailing rate system. In my July 22, 1976
legislative program message, I urged action on the proposal before adjournment
of the 94th Congress. I am convinced that the bill will help correct inconsistencies
in the prevailing rate system and I wish to reiterate my concern for its passage.

Letter to the Speaker of the House and the President of the Senate
on Citizenship Requirements for Federal Employment.
September 2, 1976
PURSUANT to the authority vested in him by the Constitution and Section
3301 of Title 5 and Section 301 of Title 3 of the United States Code, the Presi-
dent authorized the United States Civil Service Commission to establish stand-
ards with respect to citizenship for employment in the competitive service
(Executive Order No. 10577, as amended, 5 CFR Part 2). Thereafter, the Com-
mission prohibited generally the appointment of aliens to positions in the
competitive service (5 CFR 338.101).
The Supreme Court of the United States has recently held that the Civil
Service Commission's general prohibition against the employment of aliens is
violative of the due process clause of the Fifth Amendment to the Constitution
(Hampton v. Mow Sun Wong, No. 73â€“1596, June 1, 1976).
