Message to the Congress Outlining 1977 Tax
Reduction Proposals. January 4, 1977
To the Congress of the United States:
In October 1975, I presented to the Congress a program of tax cuts and spend-
ing restraints that would have reduced the burden of government for all tax-
payers. It would have given the American people more freedom to spend their
incomes as they choose rather than as Washington chooses for them. However,
Congress decided otherwiseâ€”to increase spending far more than I wanted and
to cut taxes far less than I wanted.
My forthcoming 1978 Budget will provide a detailed blueprint for Federal
spending. Today, as I promised, I am outlining my proposals for personal and
business tax reductions in 1977. First, I again urge a permanent increase in the
personal exemption from $750 to $1,000 to replace the system of temporary tax
credits that have so greatly complicated the individual income tax return. I
am also recommending an increase in the low income allowance and a series
of permanent tax rate reductions. In total, my proposals provide income tax
relief for individuals of approximately $10 billion in 1977. The tax reduc-
tions of 1975 and 1976 focused tax relief on the lower income taxpayer. How-
ever, it is high time to focus substantial tax relief on middle income taxpayers.
The tax relief I seek will cut the 1977 income taxes of a typical family with four
with an income of $15,000 by $227.
In the long run, inflation and real economic growth constantly push taxpayers
into higher and higher tax brackets if tax law remains unchanged. Some
believe that these additional tax receipts should be spent on new Federal
programs. I do not. Instead, I believe that the Congress should periodically
counteract the growing burden imposed by the tax system by providing off-
setting tax cuts while continuing to restrain the rate of growth of Federal
spending.
The creation of good permanent jobs for our expanding labor force requires
a higher level of private investment. I am, therefore, recommending again a
permanent reduction in the corporate income tax from 48 to 46 percent. This
would reduce business tax liabilities by $2.5 billion in 1977.
I also urge making permanent the 10 percent investment tax credit and the
surtax exemption provisions of the Tax Reform Act of 1976. In the longer run
we must eliminate the double taxation of dividend payments. I am, therefore,
