Statement on the Death of Representative Jerry Litton
of Missouri. August 3, 1976
I WAS shocked and saddened to learn of the tragic death of Representative Jerry
Litton, his wife, and their two children.
During the time that I knew Jerry Litton, I considered him to be a valued
colleague and an effective Representative of his constituents.
Mrs. Ford joins me in expressing profound sympathy to Jerry Litton's relatives
and friends.
NOTE: Representative Litton was a Member of Congress from 1972 until he died in Chillicothe, Mo., in
the crash of a private plane.

Remarks on Greeting Delegates to a Joint Session
of Boys/Girls Nation. August 4, 1976
Good afternoon, Commander Wiles, Mrs. Schanel, Vince Marazita, boys, girls
of this wonderful organization, your officers and the participants:
Mrs. Ford and I are very, very delighted to have the opportunity of saying
hello and welcoming almost 300 of the first joint Boys/Girls Nation.
I congratulate each and every one of you, first for being selected to attend
this very unique event, but also, just as importantly, your accomplishments and
your activities here in the Nation's Capital. Obviously, you have won the respect
of your fellow students, your high school teachers and administrators, and the
representatives of government at every level.
I couldn't help noticing that three of your four highest officers are from
Michigan-[laughter]â€”including your president. I won't say anything more.
I like your thinking. [Laughter]
Let me take this opportunity to thank my fellow members of the American
Legion and its Auxiliary for making Boys Nation and Girls Nation a success.
Since 1935, when the idea of student participation in government was first con-
ceived by the American Legion, the Legion has worked very diligently to help
our young people gain an understanding of democracy as it is best practiced
