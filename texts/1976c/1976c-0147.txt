Message to the Senate Transmitting a Protocol To Amend the
Interim Convention on Conservation of North Pacific Fur Seals.
July 19, 1976
To the Senate of the United States:
With a view to receiving the advice and consent of the Senate to ratification,
I transmit herewith the Protocol amending the Interim Convention on Con-
servation of North Pacific Fur Seals, signed at Washington on February 9, 1957,
which Protocol was signed at Washington on May 7, 1976, on behalf of the
Governments of Canada, Japan, the Union of Soviet Socialist Republics, and the
United States of America.
The provisions of the Protocol were initially formulated by the North Pacific
Fur Seal Conference held at Washington from December 1 through Decem-
ber 12, 1975.
I transmit also for the information of the Senate, the report by the Depart-
ment of State with respect to the Protocol.
This Protocol is significant because it permits the continuation in force, with
minor modifications, of the only international agreement affording protection to
the fur seals of the North Pacific. I recommend that the Senate give favorable
consideration to this Protocol at an early date because all the States party to
the Interim Convention must ratify the Protocol prior to October 14, 1976 to
prevent the lapse of the Interim Convention.
The White House,
GERALD R. FORD

NOTE: The protocol and accompanying papers are printed in Senate Executive M (94th Cong., 2d sess.).
