Public Papers of the Presidents
Congress on the reorganization of Federal energy and natural resources
activities.
A study of alternative organizational arrangements has been underway since
May 1976 under the leadership of the Office of Management and Budget and the
Energy Resources Council.
After considering the alternatives, I have decided to recommend that the
Congress approve creation of a Department of Energy. The details of the pro-
posed organization, together with the necessary legislation, are included in the
enclosed report which was prepared by the Office of Management and Budget
and the Energy Resources Council.
I commend the report to the attention of the Congress and urge prompt action
to create a Department of Energy.

Message to the Congress Transmitting Quarterly
Report of the Council on Wage and Price Stability.
January 11, 1977
To the Congress of the United States:
In accordance with section 5 of the Council on Wage and Price Stability
Act, as amended, I hereby transmit to the Congress the eighth quarterly report
of the Council on Wage and Price Stability. This report contains a description
of the Council activities during the third quarter of 1976 in monitoring both
prices and wages in the private sector and various Federal Government activities
that lead to higher costs and prices without creating commensurate benefits. It
discusses in some detail the Council's study of collective bargaining negotiations
for 1976, health costs, aluminum prices, and chlorine, caustic soda prices as well
as its filings before various Federal regulatory agencies.
During the remainder of 1976, the Council on Wage and Price Stability will
continue to play an important role in supplementing fiscal and monetary policies
