PATENT MODERNIZATION AND REFORM ACT
This legislation would substantially strengthen the American patent system
by improving the strength and reliability of issued patents through procedural
reforms in the patent examination and issuance process. It would also simplify
procedures for obtaining patents, make more complete and precise the dis-
closure of information about technology contained in patents, and add new pro-
visions concerning enforcement of patents.
WINTER OLYMPIC GAMES ASSISTANCE
This legislation would authorize Federal financial assistance for the con-
struction of certain permanent, unique sports facilities needed for the 1980 Win-
ter Olympic Games at Lake Placid, New York. The total amount of special
Federal assistance under both existing authorities and this legislation would not
exceed $28 million plus the financing of certain increases in construction costs.
These are important legislative proposals dealing with matters of the National
interest, and I urge the Congress to move with dispatch to enact them.

Statement on Congressional Enactment of the Public
Works Employment Act of 1976. July 22, 1976
I AM keenly disappointed by the action of the Congress in enacting, over my
veto, the so-called Public Works Employment Act of 1976.
The Congress has badly misjudged the real public interest in enacting this
bill. What the Congress is saying in effect is that:
-It is not sufficiently concerned about the risks of double-digit inflation.
-It would rather create $4 billion worth of temporary, Government-funded
jobs than let those same dollars go to work in the private sector to produce real,
rewarding, lasting jobs.
-It wants the Federal Government to borrow yet another $4 billion from the
private sector.
