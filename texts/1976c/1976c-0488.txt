Special Message to the Congress on Federal Pay
Increases. October 2, 1976
[Dated October 1, 1976. Released October 2, 1976]
To the Congress of the United States:
In accordance with the provisions of Section 5305 of Title 5 of the United
States Code, I hereby report on the comparability adjustment I am ordering
for the Federal statutory pay systems in October 1976.
The Director of the Office of Management and Budget and the Chairman
of the United States Civil Service Commission, who serve jointly as my agent
for Federal pay, have proposed a 4.83 percent average increase in pay rates for
the Federal statutory pay systems. The Advisory Committee on Federal Pay
and the Federal Employees Pay Council have proposed adjustments of 5.82
percent and 8.2 percent, respectively.
I have decided that I should choose the 4.83 percent increase. My selection
of this proposal will implement immediately several reforms which are clearly
necessary for the continued integrity of the pay adjustment process.
I am transmitting herewith the reports of my agent and the Advisory Com-
mittee, as well as a copy of the Executive order [11941] I have promulgated to
put this pay adjustment into effect.
The White House,
October 1, 1976.

I HAVE signed H.R. 15194, the Public Works Employment Appropriations
Act of 1976.
In July I vetoed the authorizing legislation which made this $3.95 [$3.73]
billion appropriation necessary. I said then, and I still believe, that these funds
will not create lasting jobs but will create new inflationary pressures.
I said then, and I still believe, that the best and most effective way to create
new jobs is to pursue balanced economic policies that encourage the growth of
