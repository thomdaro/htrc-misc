Message to the Congress Transmitting the United States-Polish
International Fishery Agreement. September 16, 1976
To the Congress of the United States:
In accordance with The Fishery Conservation and Management Act of 1976
(P.L. 94-265; 16 U.S.C. 1801), I transmit herewith a governing international
fishery agreement between the United States and the Polish People's Republic,
signed at Warsaw on August 2, 1976.
This Agreement is significant because it is the first to be negotiated in accord-
ance with that legislation. I recommend the Congress give favorable considera-
tion to this Agreement at an early date. I further recommend that, in the event
60 calendar days of continuous session as required by the legislation are not
available before March 1, 1977, the Congress consider issuance of a joint resolu-
tion in order to bring this Agreement into force by that date.
The White House,
September 16, 1976.

Remarks Following a Meeting With Southern
Republican Leaders. September 16, 1976
GERALD R. FORD
I HAVE some very outstanding leaders of the Republican Party from a very
important area of the country. As you will recall, when I was in Vail I said
we were going to have a national campaign. Some of you doubted it. I want to
repeat it, and I will give you some evidence of what we are going to do to
show the good faith of that comment.
On Saturday, September 25, we are going to fly from here to Louisiana, and
