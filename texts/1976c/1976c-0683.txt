Statement on Signing the Arthritis, Diabetes, and Digestive
Disease Amendments of 1976. October 20, 1976
I HAVE signed S. 2910, the Arthritis, Diabetes, and Digestive Disease Amend-
ments of 1976. Arthritis, diabetes, and diseases of the digestive tract affect mil-
lions of Americans and claim an inestimable toll in human suffering and
disability among our citizens and their families.
A major purpose of S. 2910 is the establishment of national advisory boards
for diabetes and arthritis, and a National Commission on Digestive Diseases to
develop a long-range plan for the control of digestive diseases.
Since S. 2910 will clearly provide appropriate support of our efforts to solve
the problems associated with these diseases, it has my enthusiastic endorsement.
The state of the art study and development of the long-range plan by the Na-
tional Commission on Digestive Diseases, for example, will be very helpful to
the Department of Health, Education, and Welfare in planning its programs in
this area.
The enactment of S. 2910 will aid the Government's efforts to alleviate the
problems of those afflicted with these serious and disabling diseases. I am happy
to approve it.
NOTE: As enacted, S. 2910, approved October 19, 1976, is Public Law 94â€“562 (90 Stat. 2645).

THE PRESIDENT. Won't you all sit down.
It is easier to get in the Rose Garden. I guess we had better go back to it. We
just had a doorknob break off. [Laughter]
REPORTER. That is a sign of the times.
THE PRESIDENT. You can't blame that on me.
