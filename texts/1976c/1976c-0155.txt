it represents how proud we are in 1976 to enjoy the friendship and the good will
of all the countries that are represented here this evening.
NOTE: The President spoke at 10:04 p.m. in the
Rose Garden at the White House where he and
Mrs. Ford hosted the Bicentennial celebration for
members of the diplomatic corps, Ambassadors to
the Organization of American States, the congres-
sional leadership, and members of the Cabinet.

Statement Following Senate Action on the Public Works
Employment Act of 1976. July 21, 1976
I DEEPLY regret today that the Senate has overridden my veto of the public
works bill.
Both the Senate and I share a keen desire to expand job opportunities for all
Americans, but I continue to believe that the wisest, most productive means of
reaching that goal is through a steadily growing private sector—not through
temporary jobs that are run by the Government, increase the national debt,
and create new inflationary pressures.
The House can rectify the Senate action on Thursday and should, in the best
interest of the Nation, sustain my veto.
NOTE: On July 22, 1976, the Senate voted to override
the President's veto, and S. 3201 was enacted as
Public Law 94-369 (90 Stat. 999).
For the President's message to the Senate ve-
toing the legislation and a statement on congres-
sional enactment of the legislation, see Items 653
and 686.

Remarks Upon Signing a Special Message to the Congress
Urging Action on Pending Legislation. July 22, 1976
I HAVE a serious and growing concern over the outlook for congressional
action during the remainder of 1976.
Time for action is rapidly dwindling. An enormous backlog of work is piling
up on congressional desks. Important laws must be passed this year in many
areas:
—to cut taxes and to cut spending;
-to expand catastrophic health care program;
—to set up a national swine flu program;
—to limit court-ordered school busing;
