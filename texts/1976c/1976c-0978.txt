THE PRESIDENT. Highly likely.
Q. Sir, have you finished work on your State of the Union yet?
THE PRESIDENT. That will be finished the night before we give it, and
maybe the day we give it.

REPORTER. Mr. President, do you have any New Year's wishes?
THE PRESIDENT. Well, I certainly want all Americans and all people through-

I think we can have that health and happiness and prosperity.
Q. Mr. President, did you make any personal resolutions for the New Year?
