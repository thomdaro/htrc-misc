Exchange With a Reporter on Arrival at Dallas, Texas.
October 9, 1976
REPORTER. Mr. Carter said yesterday that he wants you to give the American
public some more facts about that IRS report concerning your campaign funds
in 1972. He says we need to know more about that.
THE PRESIDENT. Well, all of those were thoroughly investigated by the FBI,
by the IRS, and by two committees of the Congress, and they gave me an
absolute clean bill of health.
I suggest that people who throw stones shouldn't live in glass houses.
Thank you very much.
NOTE: The exchange began at 9:50 a.m. at Love Field.

Remarks at Opening Ceremonies for the Texas State
Fair in Dallas. October 9, 1976
Thank you very, very much, Governor Briscoe, Mrs. Briscoe, Governor Connally
and Mrs. Connally, Mayor Folsom, Wayne Gallagher, distinguished guests,
ladies and gentlemen:
It's always great to be back in Texas and especially in Dallas, and I thank you.
I am deeply honored to have the privilege of opening your world-famous
State Fair. John Connally has just given me a preview of the livestock barns.
John is an expert on cattle, swine, and sheep, just like he is an expert on national
security and government—from Austin to Washington, D.C.—and thank you
very much, John.
There is a lot left to see, but I have learned one thing. When Texans talk about
the fine things you produce in Texas, whether it's cattle or cotton, spaceships or
sheep, pecans or petroleum, you're really not bragging, you're really just being
modest. Even your peanuts taste better to me. [Laughter]
I'm told you produce some pretty good football teams. Good luck this after-
noon. Nobody wants to stand or sit in the sun on a beautiful football Saturday
in October and listen to a long Presidential address. I'll tell you what. When we
have the Ford-Dole inauguration down in Washington next January, you all
come.
