ARCHIBALD MACLEISH
Archibald MacLeish, represented by his nephew, Roderick MacLeish. “Poet
and playwright, teacher and statesman, Archibald MacLeish has combined the
vocation of man of letters with that of public spokesman. A poet of realities as
well as dreams, his eloquent words are matched by his sensitive social conscience.
He seeks truth inspired by love of his fellow men and of his country. We are
proud to recognize his stature as a humanist, an artist, and an American."
JAMES ALBERT MICHENER

generation with his compelling essays and novels. From 'Tales of the South
Pacific,' to 'Centennial,' the prolific writings of this master storyteller have
expanded the knowledge and enriched the lives of million."

Vice President of the United States, his long years of service to his country have
yielded governmental, economic, social and cultural contributions beyond
measures."

selves have become a beloved part of the American tradition.”

her keen interest and involvement have enriched immeasurably our Nation's
cultural life."
