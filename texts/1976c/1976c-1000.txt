Public Papers of the Presidents
—Implement my comprehensive nuclear policy statement issued on Octo-
ber 28, 1976.
-Continue ERDA's development program on the liquid metal fast breeder
reactor—to resolve any remaining environmental, safety and safeguards ques-
tions—so that this technology will be available to bridge the gap until advanced
technologies can make their contribution to our energy needs.
-Provide increased operating funds for other Federal energy activities.
I urge the Congress to approve these funding requests.
REORGANIZATION OF FEDERAL ENERGY ACTIVITIES
Under the provisions of the Energy Conservation and Production Act of
August 1976, I am called upon to make recommendations to the Congress with
respect to the reorganization of Federal energy and natural resource activities.
At my direction, a major study of alternatives had already been undertaken in
May 1976 under the leadership of the Energy Resources Council and the Office
of Management and Budget.
I have reviewed the findings and recommendations from the study. Within
the next few days, I will forward my recommendations to the Congress.
TIME TO ACT
The Nation has waited far too long for completion of a sound and effective
national energy policy. In many cases, the issues are complex and controversial,
the decisions are tough to make—particularly because the right decisions will
be unpopular in the short run. The costs of continued energy dependence are
far too great for further delay.
The Congress can act. It is a matter of organizing itself to make the tough
decisions and choices and moving ahead with the task. I urge the Congress
to weigh the alternatives carefully and proceed promptly.
The White House,
January 7, 1977.
