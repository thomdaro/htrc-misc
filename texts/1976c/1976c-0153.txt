Gerald R. Ford, 1976
Shirley was one of several candidates, and I thought she would make an excel-
lent Member of the House of Representatives. But fate didn't turn it out that
way, so you went the diplomatic route in your efforts to come to Washington.
You have been so successful in the latter, it's probably better that you didn't
win it before. [Laughter]
AMBASSADOR BLACK. Mr. President, I think you are an excellent President.
[Laughter]
THE PRESIDENT. It is real nice to see you, and the very best to you.
NOTE: The President spoke at 2:37 p.m. in the Cabinet Room at the White House.
