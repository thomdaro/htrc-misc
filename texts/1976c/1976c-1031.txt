Message to the Congress Transmitting Protocols to the
Convention on International Carriage by Air.
January 14, 1977
To the Senate of the United States:
I transmit herewith, for the advice and consent of the Senate to ratification
two related Protocols done at Montreal on September 25, 1975 entitled:
a) Additional Protocol No. 3 to Amend the Convention for the Unifica-
tion of Certain Rules Relating to International Carriage by Air, signed at
Warsaw on October 12, 1929, as Amended by the Protocols done at The
Hague, on September 28, 1955, and at Guatemala City, March 8, 1971 (here-
inafter, Montreal Protocol No. 3); and
b) Montreal Protocol No. 4 to Amend the Convention for the Unifica-
tion of Certain Rules Relating to International Carriage by Air, signed at
Warsaw on October 12, 1929, as Amended by the Protocol done at The Hague
on September 8, 1955 (hereinafter, Montreal Protocol No. 4).
The report of the Department of State with respect to the protocols is en-
closed for the information of the Senate in connection with its considera-
tion of them. The two protocols provide a set of modernized rules applicable
to international air carriage of passengers, baggage, and cargo to replace cur-
rently applicable provisions of the 1929 Warsaw Convention, to which the
United States has been party since 1934.
The United States has been one of the leaders in the efforts which have re-
sulted in the adoption of Montreal Protocols No. 3 and No. 4. For nearly two
decades the United States, while recognizing the value of a unified legal regime
which would assure stability in international air transportation, has sought to
ensure that the regime would be responsive to the needs of today's international
air travelers and shippers. To this end this government has been in the fore-
front in urging amendments to the Warsaw Convention to provide for no-
fault liability of air carriers, increased limits of liability, and rapid settlement of
