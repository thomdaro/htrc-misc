Statement Announcing Recommendation for the Replacement
of Locks and Dam 26 on the Mississippi River.
August 24, 1976
I AM pleased to announced today that the Secretary of the Army has recom-
mended to the Congress authorization of a replacement for Locks and Dam 26
located on the Mississippi River, just north of St. Louis, Mo.
Locks and Dam 26 is a vital link in our inland waterway system. For example,
last year over 26 million tons of grain—equal to 25% of our entire production
bound for export-moved through this facility.
The existing structure—nearly 40 years old—has deteriorated so significantly
that it will be neither safe nor reliable for continued navigation over the decades
ahead. Resulting delays in traffic will be increasingly costly and disruptive.
Accordingly, since 1969, the Secretary of the Army has sought replacement.
However, progress on replacement has been halted by a court ruling which
requires enactment of authorizing legislation and preparation of a new environ-
mental impact statement.
The Secretary of the Army has now completed and filed a final environmental
impact statement and is requesting the Congress to act on the required author-
izing legislation. I urge the Congress to act quickly in providing this needed
authority. Upon enactment, I shall direct the Secretary of the Army to proceed
with construction as expeditiously as possible. We cannot afford further delay.
NOTE: The statement was released at Vail, Colo.
