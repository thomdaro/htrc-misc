Special Message to the Congress Reporting on Budget
Deferrals. January 7, 1977
To the Congress of the United States:
In accordance with the Impoundment Control Act of 1974, I herewith report
four new routine deferrals of funds totalling $685.0 million. The deferred funds
were provided for the U.S. Railway Association and the U.S. Information
Agency.
In addition, I am reporting routine revisions to five deferrals previously
transmitted. They relate to programs of the Departments of Commerce and
Health, Education, and Welfare, the General Services Administration, and the
American Revolution Bicentennial Administration. The combined effect of the
revisions is to increase the amount deferred by $130,000.
The details of each deferral are contained in the attached reports.
The White House,
January 7, 1977.
GERALD R. FORD
NOTE: The attachments detailing the deferrals are printed in the Federal Register of January 10, 1977 (42 FR

Message to the Congress Transmitting the United
States-China International Fishery Agreement.
January 10, 1977
To the Congress of the United States:
In accordance with the Fishery Conservation and Management Act of 1976
(P.L. 94-265; 16 USC 1801), I transmit herewith a governing international
fishery agreement between the United States and the Republic of China, signed
at Washington on September 15, 1976.
This Agreement is significant because it is one of the first to be negotiated in
accordance with that legislation. I urge that the Congress give favorable con-
sideration to this Agreement at an early date. Since 60 calendar days of con-
tinuous session as required by the legislation are not available before March 1,
2903
