ENVIRONMENT
FEDERAL WATER POLLUTION CONTROL ACT AMENDMENTS
The 1976 amendments proposed to the Act would affect future funding of the
waste water treatment grant program. They would focus Federal funding on
the construction of treatment plants and associated interceptor sewers; eliminate
the eligibility of that portion of each project designed to serve reserve capacity
for future population growth; and authorize the Administrator of EPA to ex-
tend the July 1, 1977 deadline for compliance with secondary treatment and
water quality standards on a case-by-case basis for periods not to exceed six
years. In addition, extensions of appropriation authorizations were proposed
for FY 76 and FY 77.
COMPREHENSIVE OIL POLLUTION LIABILITY AND COMPENSATION ACT
The Comprehensive Oil Pollution Liability and Compensation Act of 1975
would establish a $200 million domestic fund which would be available to
compensate individuals who suffer damages from oil spills in U.S. waters.
The bill would create a uniform nationwide system of strict liability for oil
spill damages and a standard procedure for settlement of claims. It would also
implement two international conventions which deal with oil pollution caused
by tankers on the high seas.
INCOME ASSISTANCE
NATIONAL FOOD STAMP REFORM ACT
This proposal would concentrate food stamp program benefits on those truly
in need, significantly improve program administration, and correct abuses and
inequities of the current program. A standard deduction would replace the
present set of complex itemized deductions; eligibility would be limited to
those whose net income is below the poverty level; families would be required
to spend 30 percent of household income for stamps; a more realistic measure
of actual income over the preceding 90 days would be used to determine eligi-
bility; categorical eligibility for public assistance recipients would be eliminated;
and able-bodied recipients would be required to seek, accept, and retain gainful
employment.
