Gerald R. Ford, 1976
have been debated at length by the Congress and the time for action has
arrived.
The priority categories for action are familiar ones:
-tax reductions coupled with spending restraint
-crime control
-restoring the integrity of the Social Security System
-catastrophic health care protection for those covered by Medicare
-restrictions on forced, court ordered busing
-revenue sharing and block grants
-regulatory reform
-energy
-indemnification of swine flu manufacturers
-the remainder of my defense program plus defense cost saving legislation
--and other legislation ranging from agriculture to the environment; from
higher education to reform of the Federal retirement system.
In the agenda that follows, I have listed the specific legislation that needs to
be passed by the Congress. I am convinced that the passage of these bills is in
the real interest of all of the American people.
TAXES
PERMANENT TAX REDUCTION
This proposal would provide a $28 billion permanent income tax reduction
effective July 1, 1976. Major provisions affecting individual income taxes include
an increase in personal exemptions from $750 to $1,000, a reduction in tax
rates, and substitution of a flat standard deduction for the low income allow-
ance and percentage standard deduction.
ESTATE AND GIFT TAX ADJUSTMENT ACT
This legislation would raise the estate tax exemption from $60 thousand to
$150 thousand and make all transfers of assets between spouses exempt from
estate and gift taxes. The estate tax rate structure would be altered so that taxes
on the largest estates would remain unchanged.
In addition, this legislation would make it easier to continue the family own-
ership of a small farm or business following an owner's death. This would be
accomplished by liberalizing present rules governing installment payments
of estate taxes attributable to a small family farm or closely-held business by
2059
