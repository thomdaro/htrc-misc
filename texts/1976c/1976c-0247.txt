Exchange With Governor Ronald Reagan and a Question-and-
Answer Session With Reporters in Kansas City.
August 19, 1976
THE PRESIDENT. Governor Reagan, I came over to the hotel for the purpose of
congratulating you on a very fine campaign, expressing to you our compliments
for the outstanding organization that you had. You really got us in shape.
I think the campaign you waged and the organization you put together was
beneficial to the campaign that we have, beginning right away to defeat the
Democratic nominees and to make certain that our philosophy prevails for the
next 4 years.
I thank you for your indication of full support, and again, I congratulate you
for a fine campaign. Thank you very much.
GOVERNOR REAGAN. Mr. President, my congratulations to you. It was a good
fight, Mom, and he won. My congratulations.
And, of course, you know that as we both agreed all the way from the very
beginning, once the fight was over, we are on the same side, and we go forward
together.
QUESTIONS
REPORTER. Mr. President, did you discuss the Vice-Presidency with Governor
Reagan?
THE PRESIDENT. I talked about a number of possibilities. We had a discussion
in that regard, yes.
Q. Mr. President, was Mr. Reagan one of those possibilities you discussed?
THE PRESIDENT. This is a private matter between Governor Reagan and my-
self, and I don't think we should comment further.
Q. Governor Reagan, are you prepared to campaign actively for President
Ford in the election?
