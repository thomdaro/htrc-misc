-It is willing to fund jobs at a cost of $25,000 apiece for each year of temporary
employment created.
-And it would rather have the Federal Government borrow and spend yet
another $4 billion than enact my proposed $10 billion added tax cut which would
help all of our people.
My concern about our unemployed citizens is second to none. But that concern
strengthens my resolve to do everything I can to keep our economy on the strong,
stable growth path we are now on-a path that does not risk a return to double-
digit inflation and another deep recession. My concern does not and will not
stampede me into embracing unwise legislation.
It is my hope that the Congress, on reflection, will agree with my views and
not insist on providing funds to carry out this program. If it does insist on
going ahead with this program, there will be no real winners but there will be
real losers: the American people.
NOTE: On July 22, 1976, the bill (S. 3201) was enacted over the President's veto as Public Law 94-369
(90 Stat. 999).

Statement on Progress Made Toward Federal Paperwork
Reduction. July 23, 1976
LAST FALL, I directed the departments and agencies of the Federal Govern-
ment to reduce the number of repetitive Federal reports by 10 percent no later
than July 1 of this year. OMB Director James T. Lynn, who has been carrying
out this directive, has confirmed this morning that our goal has not only been
reached but exceeded.
As of October 31, 1975, the departments and agencies of the executive branch
subject to the Federal Reports Act were employing 5,148 reports to collect in-
formation from the public. Today, there are a total of 4,504 forms in use. That
reduction of over 600 forms represents a net cut of 12.5 percent and a very impor-
tant first step toward reducing the Federal burden on the American people.
I might note that several agencies in the Government that are not subject
to the Federal Reports Act have also made significant progress. At the Treasury
Department, the Internal Revenue Service has achieved a net reduction of 724
forms, or a 31-percent cut, and the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco and Firearms
has marked up a 25-percent cut in its reporting system. Among the independent
