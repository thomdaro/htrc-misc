Gerald R. Ford, 1976
conducive to unity, to harnessing the tremendous economic and political and
human strength of our country. And I believe that the transition will be one
which will be conducive to peace in our own Nation and peace around the
world.
And I'd like to again express my thanks to President Ford and to Mrs. Ford
for being so good to us. My wife and Mrs. Ford had a chance to visit this
afternoon. Rosalynn has gone back to Georgia, and I will be staying up here
until tomorrow. But I do thank you again, President Ford, for making it
possible for me to learn in this way and for being so hospitable to me and my
wife.
NOTE: The President spoke at 4:45 p.m. on the
South Drive at the White House.
As printed above, this item follows the text of
the White House press release.

Message to President Valéry Giscard d'Estaing of
France on the Death of André Malraux.
November 23, 1976
IN BEHALF of the American people, I extend my deepest sympathy to you
and to the people of France on the passing of André Malraux.
France has lost one of her finest sons. Modern civilization has lost a dynamic
and creative spirit. The deep concern of André Malraux for his fellow man, his
contributions to shaping a better world, and his creativity as a philosopher,
novelist, and historian will endure as a lasting memorial.
