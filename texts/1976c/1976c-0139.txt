Gerald R. Ford, 1976
cumstances, that the athletes are able to compete, and I am proud of the
American successes.
PRESIDENT FORD'S CAMPAIGN APPROACH
[28.] Q. Mr. President, will your race with Jimmy Carter be a conserva-
tive versus a liberal race? What is the difference between your philosophy and
Mr. Carter's in those terms?
THE PRESIDENT. I am not going to pass judgment on my opponent's campaign.
We are going to run our own campaign, which is one of a record of accomplish-
ment in foreign policy, domestic policy, and the restoration of trust in the
White House. What they do is for them to decide.
Q. You cannot then describe Carter as a liberal?
THE PRESIDENT. I am not going to pin a label on anybody. I am going to just
say that we have done a good job, and on the basis of doing a good job, I think
the American people will want the same kind of a job done for the next 4 years.
LEGAL REQUIREMENT FOR A PRESIDENTIAL ELECTION COMMITTEE
[29.] Q. Mr. President, when you were Vice President you said that you
would not employ anything such as CREEP [Committee for the Re-Election of
the President], as President Nixon had, that you would have no separate com-
mittee. Now we understand there will be a President Ford election committee
and you will not be relying entirely on the Republican National Committee.
THE PRESIDENT. I think that is caused by the election reform act that was
passed late in 1974. When I made that speech out in Chicago-I think some-
time in 1973 or early 1974-that election law had not been enacted. Once that law
was enacted, it does require that you maintain a national committee and that
the candidate for the Presidency have a separate organization. So, as much as I
might want to put the two together, it is precluded by the law itself.
QUALIFICATION TO BE PRESIDENT
[30.] Q. Mr. President, Senator Mondale says that you didn't have the intel-
ligence to be a good President. What do you think?
THE PRESIDENT. Well, I think the American people will judge that.
MEETINGS WITH UNCOMMITTED DELEGATES
[31.] Q. Mr. President, can we assume that you will see all the noncommit-
ted delegates by the time the convention begins?
THE PRESIDENT. I would hope I could, but I can't categorically promise that.
I would like to, definitely.
