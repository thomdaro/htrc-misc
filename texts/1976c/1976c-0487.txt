-Providing economic development and technical assistance to the poorer
nations of the world; and
-Providing food assistance and disaster relief.
As the world's strongest economic power with the greatest global reach, the
United States derives many tangible benefits from these United Nations activi-
ties, many of which resulted from American initiative and leadership.
Despite difficulties inherent in working within an organization of so many
sovereign states having differing interests and backgrounds, I believe that we
are making progress in achieving our purposes in the United Nations. The
United States is working actively to defend its interests, to oppose irresponsible
actions and to promote cooperation among UN members in fulfillment of the
great purposes of the Charter which we helped to frame.
As the world grows increasingly complex and interdependent, I conclude
that United States leadership and participation in the United Nations serves our
interests and hopes for realizing mankind's aspirations for a world of peace,
economic progress and social justice.
