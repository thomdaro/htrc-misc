Public Papers of the Presidents
I have requested funds to construct two new VA hospitals and the funds to
design six more, which will be built as readily as possible.
The administration is committed to doing right by the American veterans.
They served their country well in time of war. It is only right we serve them
well in times of peace.
The administration is also committed to continuing the fight against infla-
tion. The threat it poses to Americans living on fixed pensions and benefits,
such as veterans and the elderly, cannot be tolerated. While adjusting social
security and veterans benefits for the cost of living, we will continue to do
everything we can to remove the underlying causes of inflation. In the long run,
that is the only way to ensure the economic security of all Americans.
Now it is my pleasure to sign H.R. 14298 and to commend the Members of
Congress, particularly the two veterans committees, and all Members, for en-
acting this legislation which, as I said, is a way of our expressing to all of them,
the veterans of America, the great respect and admiration that we have for all
of them.
Thank you very much.
NOTE: The President spoke at 12:21 p.m. at a cere-
mony in the East Room at the White House.

Statement on Signing Two Veterans Benefits Bills.
September 30, 1976
I AM pleased to sign into law H.R. 14298 and H.R. 14299, bills which will pro-
vide cost-of-living increases in pension and compensation payments for approx-
imately 5 million veterans and their survivors. These increases will become effec-
tive this Friday, October 1, 1976.
Last December 1975, I signed a bill that provided a temporary cost-of-living
increase in veterans pensions for the first 9 months of this year. One of the bills
I am signing today, H.R. 14298, would make that increase permanent and thus
prevent more than 24 million veterans and their families from having their
pension payments reduced next week. This bill, in addition, will provide a 7-
percent cost-of-living increase in pension benefits beginning January 1, 1977.
The second bill I am signing, H.R. 14299, will raise compensation benefits for
service-disabled veterans and their survivors by 8 percent on October 1, 1976,
