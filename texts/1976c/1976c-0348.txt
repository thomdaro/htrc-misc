Statement Following Senate Action on a Bill To Extend
the General Revenue Sharing Program. September 14, 1976
I AM extremely pleased that the Senate has today overwhelmingly adopted
legislation to extend the General Revenue Sharing program. The Senate bill
closely follows my legislative recommendations for renewal of this important
domestic program.
Continuation of this program, which provides substantial assistance to State
and local governments, remains, however, one of the major unfinished items of
business on the congressional agenda.
I urge the Democratic leadership in the House to take responsible and re-
sponsive action to convene an immediate conference on this bill. They have
sought to portray themselves as friends of our Nation's cities. However, their
record on this legislation stands in marked contrast to their rhetoric. In delaying
action on this bill for over 1 year, they have jeopardized the fiscal and eco-
nomic stability of our cities.
I hope the Congress will demonstrate its commitment by moving swiftly
and favorably in getting responsible legislation to my desk for signature before
they adjourn. To do less would only serve to aggravate the fiscal problems of
State and local governments and undermine economic recovery.
NOTE: The bill (H.R. 11367) passed the House on
September 30, 1976, and was signed by the Presi-
dent on October 13. As enacted, H.R. 11367 is
Public Law 94-488 (90 Stat. 2341).

Arbor, Michigan. September 15, 1976
FIRST OF all, I thank you very much for permitting me to join all of this
great ball team for a meal before I have a little engagement down the road here.
In those stories that I was a great alltime center, I found this-the longer you
get away from the reality, the bigger those stories get. [Laughter] So, make all
