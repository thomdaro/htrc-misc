upon this request, funds would have to be added on top of my revised 1977
Defense budget request.
Congressional Inaction on Defense Management Economies
My 1977 Defense budget estimates were based upon the assumption that the
Congress would act favorably upon a number of specific legislative proposals,
thereby achieving major economies. These savings involve pay costs and related
compensation areas and sales of certain materials from the national stockpile.
In these areas alone, the budget reflected savings of $4.0 billion for FY 1977.
For the five-year period FY 1977-81, my proposals would save $27 billion. Of
these savings, nearly $11 billion can be realized by administrative action in
revising the pay comparability process for general schedule and military per-
sonnel. I am taking the required actions. Over $16 billion of the savings are
dependent upon Congressional action, however, and these are the items which
I wish to address. Let me summarize these savings proposals requiring action
by the Congress:
• $4.7 billion (including $276 million in FY 1977) would result from re-
visions in the Federal wage board pay system to provide pay rates that are truly
comparable with those in the private sector.
• $1.1 billion (including $163 million in FY 1977) would result from chang-
ing pay practices in the Reserve and National Guard, modifying training and
assignment policies, and transferring 44,500 Naval reservists to a different pay
category. My proposals provide the levels of reserve readiness needed, and they
are equitable.
• $1.7 billion (including $61 million in FY 1977) would result from holding
future increases in military retired pay to changes in the cost of living, eliminat-
ing the additional increment which present law provides. I am aware that the
Congress has approved this change for military retirees contingent upon Con-
gressional approval of this change for civilian retirees as well.
• $1.4 billion (including $92 million in FY 1977) would result from reducing
the subsidy in military commissaries on a phased basis, while still providing
much lower prices than are available in commercial stores. This proposal is
entirely equitable considering current levels of military compensation and other
relevant factors.
$2.6 billion (including $746 million in FY 1977) would result from sale of
items from the national stockpile, which are excess to our requirements.
$4.7 billion (including $384 million in FY 1977) would result from a num-
