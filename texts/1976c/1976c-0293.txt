resources and our land itself. As our nation begins its third century, we must
renew our commitment to save this great natural heritage for the enjoyment of
future generations of Americans.
Accordingly, I strongly urge the Congress to enact the proposed "Bicentennial
Land Heritage Act of 1976", which establishes a program designed to insure
the fulfillment of this national commitment.

Statement on Extension of the Income Tax Reduction.
August 31, 1976
I AM pleased that yesterday's agreement by a House-Senate conference com-
mittee has moved us one step closer to a reduction in individual income taxes.¹
But no one should be fooled at this apparent progress. The Congress had the
opportunity to enact a much bigger tax cut-the $28 billion tax cut that I recom-
mended earlier this year—but it chose not to grant the American people the addi-
tional tax relief they deserve.
In effect, this tax bill means that the Democratic majority in the Congress
is giving the country only half a loaf-the half it already has—and letting the
other half be swallowed up by the big spenders.
