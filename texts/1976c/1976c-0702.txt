Statement on the 1976 Nobel Prize Winners.
October 21, 1976
I KNOW that all Americans are truly proud today knowing that our fellow
countrymen have won every Nobel Prize for 1976.
If there is a world Olympics in the arts and sciences, it is the Nobel Prize. In

The credit belongs, of course, to the individuals whose talents and dedication
have won this magnificent distinction. But let us never forget our belief—
expressed so well in the Declaration of Independence—that only in a free society
could the God-endowed talents of individuals find complete fulfillment.
How happy our Founding Fathers would be at these achievements. How
elated Benjamin Franklin would have been with the scientific awards. How
grateful John Adams would have been with the awards in economics and in
literature.
And finally, how pleased Thomas Jefferson would have been with this finest
possible Bicentennial birthday gift for a land devoted to freedom and
opportunity.

Seven years ago, the Nation decided to cut in half the decided noise of jet
aircraft. For the last 2 years, all new jet planes have met these standards. The
biggest part of the airport noise problem, here at Kennedy and elsewhere, is
