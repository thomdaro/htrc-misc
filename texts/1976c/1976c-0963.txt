confidential Presidential or Vice Presidential portions of the material conveyed;
or the rights I may have as a former member of Congress to assert and enforce

(b) To have such archival facility embrace the full scope of my materials
relating to my entire political and public career in the three different Constitu-

(c) To permit the establishment and operation of such archival facility in
Ann Arbor, Michigan, in connection with a long-established, diversified and

researchers from throughout this nation and from other countries, and where the
usefulness of the materials deposited will be enhanced by the availability of

(d) To take advantage on a temporary basis of facilities on the campus of

(e) To enable the United States to maintain and operate a museum in Grand
Rapids, Michigan, as another facility of my Presidential archival depository, in
a building to be provided by an appropriate organization, for housing and
exhibiting the many articles of commemorative and educational value among
the conveyed materials, together with tangible gifts received by the United
States during and because of my service as President, where they will be readily
available for viewing by the people in the area of my home town whom I
