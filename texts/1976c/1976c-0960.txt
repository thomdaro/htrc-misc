Public Papers of the Presidents
Let's enjoy ourselves. That is why you are here.
She [Betty Ford] wanted to make a speech, and I told her she couldn't.
[Laughter]
But let me have one of my special friends and one of the great, great people
in the Congress, John McCormack, come up here. You don't have to make a
speech, but some of you don't know him. Those who didn't serve with him
don't know how tough he could be on Democrats and Republicans. Isn't that
right, John?
SPEAKER MCCORMACK. No, it's wrong. [Laughter]
THE PRESIDENT. We love you, John, and it's an honor for us to have you here.
SPEAKER MCCORMACK. All I want to say is that it's only in America that this
could happen. Thank you, Mr. President.
THE PRESIDENT. Thank you, John.
Let's have fun. Thank you all.
NOTE: The President spoke at 9:55 p.m. in the East Room at the White House.

Statement on the Death of Peter Lisagor.
December 10, 1976
FOR MORE than three decades, Peter Lisagor covered the newsbeats of the
world. His reporting spanned the globe from Vietnam to Suez and from the
United Nations to the White House.
His coverage and commentary gained for him the admiration of his col-
leagues and the respect of those he wrote about. He was a journalist in every
sense of the term, fair and thorough. But most of all, Peter will be remembered
by his many friends as a gentleman of warmth and wit. I am proud to be
counted among Peter's friends.
Betty and I extend our deepest sympathy to his family. He will be missed.
NOTE: Mr. Lisagor was the Washington bureau chief for the Chicago Daily News.
